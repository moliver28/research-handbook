## Mission

The goal of the team is to increase the technical improvements and efficiency of our contribution process to sustain our ambition of [1000+ contributors with merged MRs per month to GitLab](/company/strategy/#2-build-on-our-open-core-strength).

### FY23 Direction

In FY23 we will be focused on growing the number of unique new monthly
contributors, reducing OCMA and increasing MRARR. This will increase development
velocity without requiring additional engineering resources. Parallel to this
we'll increase observability of community contributed value through improving
the business intelligence around it. This will allow us to create some
predictability through foreshadowing. These efforts are cross-functional and
require working together with Marketing and Product Development.

This accounts for 70 - 80% of the workload. The remaining 20 - 30% is ad-hoc
work. The ad-hoc work is eclectic and ranges from supporting customers on
contributions, supporting various open source initiatives and supporting the
Engineering Productivity team.

#### Unique New Monthly Contributors

1. Minimize reliance on human interaction
1. Reduce volatility through introducing automations that drive contributions
   forward automatically
1. Capitalize on untapped potential - MRs that are active but not merged at the
   end of every single MR
1. Invest into attracting more new contributors

#### Community Contributed Value Observability

1. Introduce measurement points in various places in the contribution pipeline
1. Collect objective and subjective feedback from contributors about the process
1. Create insight into actual community contribution pipeline size
1. Standardize contribution MRARR valuation
1. Categorize contribution and measure value per type

#### Community Metrics Foreshadowing

1. Predict community metric trends
1. Empower teams to react to negative trends before they actualize
1. Define ambitious targets for FY24

#### OCMA

1. Minimize reliance on human factors that contribute to a large standard deviation
1. Support Engineering Productivity in driving OCMA down

## Working with community contributions

### Wider community MR triage reports

We have 2 triage process for the new merge requests from the wider community created under [gitlab-org](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org) 
* [Newly created Community contribution merge requests triage](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#newly-created-community-contribution-merge-requests-requiring-first-triage).
* [In-active community merge requests requiring attention](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#community-merge-requests-requiring-attention)
    * You can find a list of steps on how to nudge them in the [report template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blob/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/quality/community-contribution-mr-report.yml#L10). 

#### Contribution labels

- The `Community contribution` label is automatically applied by the [GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot) to MRs submitted by wider community members. 
  * You can see the list of MRs in [`gitLab-org` list of merge requests](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/merge_requests?label_name[]=Community+contribution).
  * [Learn more about the cadence and conditions for this automation](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#community-contributions).
- The `1st contribution` label is added to first-time contributions. Every time a contributor is opening a merge request under the `gitlab-org` namespace for the first time, the label `1st contribution` is automatically applied to the merge request.
  - You can see the list of MRs in [`gitlab-org` list of merge requests](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/merge_requests?label_name%5B%5D=1st+contribution).
  - [First-time contributors](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#first-time-contributors) are also awarded a gift as our way to say thanks.

### Merge Request Coaches

[Merge Request Coaches](/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/) are available to help contributors with their MRs. This includes: 
- Identifying reviewers for the MR.
- Answering questions from contributors.
- Educating contributors on the [contribution acceptance criteria](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#contribution-acceptance-criteria).
- Or completing the MR if the contributor is unresponsive or unable to complete.
  - In that case, the `coach will finish` label will be added to the MR and the coach will either directly push new commits to the MR, or re-create a new MR with the original changes. 
  - Contributors can mention the coaches in their MRs by typing `@gitlab-org/coaches`.

Merge Request Coaches can be found in: 
- [List of current Merge Request Coaches](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/resources/merge-request-coach-lifecycle.html#current-merge-request-coaches)
- The [team page](/company/team/) by selecting `Merge Request Coach` in the department filter.

There is also the `#mr-coaching` channel in GitLab Slack if GitLab team members have any questions related to community contributions.

More information on Merge Request Coaches (including how to become a Merge Request Coach) can be found in the [MR coach lifecycle page](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/resources/merge-request-coach-lifecycle.html).

### DCO and CLA Guidance

All external contributions to GitLab are subject to the [GitLab DCO or CLA](/community/contribute/dco-cla/), depending on where the contribution is made and on whose behalf.

Instructions for corporate contributors to enter into an overarching Corporate CLA covering all contributions made on their behalf are set out on the [DCO-CLA page](/community/contribute/dco-cla/#need-a-corporate-cla-covering-all-contributors-on-behalf-of-your-organization). 

## Recognizing contributors 

We work with the Community Relations team, to [recognize contributors](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#recognition-for-contributors) 

A nomination process is also avalilable to [nominate a contributor](handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/community-appreciation/)

## Contributor Efficiency Working group

There's a working group with members from Quality and Community Relations that
aims to streamline and improve contributor efficiency. It implements key
business iterations that results in substantial and sustained increases to
community contributors & contributions.

- Handbook page - <https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/contribution-efficiency/>
- Agenda - <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AOgqaslnq-WI1ICSZ1NzSnALf1Va4D5qAD191icAoSI/edit#>

## Code Contributor User Journey

The code contributor user journey is documented in the handbook - [User Journey](./user-journey.html)

## Strategy

We will be executing in 4 key areas in support of the company's broader [dual-flywheels](/company/strategy/#dual-flywheels) strategy to attain more contributions. The 4 key areas together are the building blocks of our contributor & contribution 10x acceleration strategy.

### Improve Contribution Velocity

Provide an outstanding and efficient contributor experience, from onboarding materials to final merge. Improve Contributor Journey, making it easier and efficient to contribute. Gather feedback from Wider community contributors and product teams on contribution friction.

#### Reduce Open Community MR Age

* **Why:** Improve the speed of contribution to production by reducing [Open community MR Age (OCMA)](/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#open-community-mr-age) & review time. We have identified product groups with the highest open contribution MR age. Analysis and improvements are needed to address product groups with the biggest opportunity. In addition to improving MR review and gathering feedback.  
* **Epic:** [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/1)
* **DRI:** Contributor Success team (Engineering)

#### Simplify & improve contribution guides 

* **Why:** Make contribution guides easy to navigate. Our current contribution guides are fragmented and can be hard for new contributors to navigate and understand. 
* **Epic:** TBD
* **DRI:** Community Relations team (Marketing)

#### Improve contribution tooling

* **Why:** Provide fast and efficient contributor experience via our tooling. Our contributor tooling needs to be optimized for contributor productivity
* **Epic:** [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/2)
* **DRI:** Engineering Productivity team (Engineering)

#### Product groups focus

* **Why:** Contribution submissions, backlog, and technology stack vary amongst all [product groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups). Providing a healthy community backlog alignment & establishing a common best practice outreach for all product groups.

* **DRI:** Contributor Success team (Engineering) & Community Relations team (Marketing)

#### Contributor career advancement

* **Why:** In Open Source Projects, the contributors‚Äô motivation in addition to solving a bug or adding a missing feature is to get experience and build their CV for career advancement. 
* **Epic:** [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/5](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/5)
* **DRI:** Contributor Success team (Engineering) 

### Expand Outreach

Increase awareness with content and events to drive large amounts of contributors. Our outreach efforts so far have been limited. A proactive and focused effort to bring awareness and drive members from external communities will be required. Engineering to work along side Community Relations in expanded outreach events.

#### Increase contribution backlog exposure

* **Why:**  Contributing as a new member to a massive project can be overwhelming, which can lead to analysis paralysis and potentially losing contributors. We should offer a lens into a discoverable, sizable set of issues we can direct newcomers to. Consider using established 3rd party platforms.
* **Epic:** TBD
* **DRI:** Community Relations team (Marketing)

#### Scale contributor events

* **Why:** Build a sense of belonging, provide the social environment for contributors to have their voice, meet with their peers, share knowledge and celebrate.
* **Epic:** TBD
* **DRI:** Community Relations team (Marketing) & Contributor Success team (Engineering)

#### Community office hours

* **Why:** We need to scale office hour calls that have traditionally been a unique opportunity for product groups to provide support, guidance to code contributors as well as gather feedback.
* **Epic:** TBD
* **DRI:** Community Relations team (Marketing) & Contributor Success team (Engineering)

#### Increase social presence

* **Why:** Increase our social media presence beyond the currently limited mediums (Twitter, gitter), which will allow us to tap into existing developer communities.  
* **Epic:** TBD
* **DRI:** Community Relations team (Marketing)

### Scale the Community

Leverage the full-time customer contributor model and create wider community teams for rapid growth.

#### Create community teams

* **Why:** Create teams of wider community members with multiple domain expertise. We would like to depart from having contributors work single-handedly and create a team that can do more together.
* **Epic:** [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/8](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/8)
* **DRI:** Contributor Success team (Engineering) 

#### Customers as contributors

* **Why:** Increased contribution by our customers eventually builds towards customers having teams inside their organization contributing to GitLab. Engineering representative that can ride along with the evangelist and program manager in interaction with customers.
* **Epic:** [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/9](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/quality/-/epics/9)
* **DRI:** Community Relations team (Marketing) & Contributor Success team (Engineering)

#### Contribution specialization 

* **Why:** To surface contribution opportunities tailored to tech professions, implement frontend, backend, UX, Test and etc specialization in contribution types and MR coaches. This also allows a more aligned interaction between contributor and MR coaches of the same specialization.
