## FY23 Direction

In FY23 we will be focused on innovative test architecture, efficiency, and customer results while delivering impact to the company's bottomline via alignment to the [top cross-functional initiatives](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/#top-cross-functional-initiatives). Key directional highlights: broaden our lead in ensuring self-managed excellence, improve deployment confidence, drive visibility and actionability of test results, and expand our Quality Architecture focus. In FY23 we anticipate continued momentum on enabling development and deployment at scale and it's more important than ever for us to deliver results.

### Self-Managed Excellence

Quality Engineering owns several tools which form a 3-prong trident for Self-Managed Excellence: the [GitLab Environment Toolkit (GET)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit), the [GitLab Performance Tool (GPT)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance), and the [Reference Architectures (RA)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/). Together, these tools support our broader strategy of cementing customer confidence and contributing to their ongoing success by ensuring their instances are built to a rigorously tested standard that performs smoothly at scale.

For more information, please visit our [Self-Managed Excellence](self-managed-excellence) page.

### Quality Architecture

Given rapidly evolving technologies and our drive to provide a world class experience for GitLab users, Quality Engineering must meet the increasing demands of efficient, intelligent test coverage and confidence at scale. We must test the right things at the right time. To that end, this year we are exploring several new testing types and visibility improvements to increase the actionability, speed, and sophistication of our various test suites.

- Machine learning for test gap recognition, failure analysis and classification, and failing fast.
- New testing types: visual regression testing, chaos testing, contract testing, permissions testing.
- Automated test pyramid analysis and code coverage visibility through a central dashboard.
- Continuous identification of broken, slow, flaky, stale, or duplicated tests.
- Built-in, one-click templates for performance and contract testing.

### Customer Centric Quality

Quality Engineering has been key to supporting prospect POVs and providing prompt, knowledgeable troubleshooting for external customers, but we also have a deep commitment to supporting our internal customers as well. We will expand our Deploy with Confidence foundation we began last year in collaboration with our Infrastructure and Development Departments, and we will seek input into how our processes and tools can be improved.

- Expand & improve upon deploy with confidence work foundation.
- Outreach to understand user's needs of Reference Architectures.
- Expand the capability of staging environments according to engineers' needs.
- Increase customer empathy by participating in activities that highlights their painpoints.
- Burn down S2 bugs to improve user experience.

### Productivity
- Reduce manual burden for SET team members on-call.
- Improve test failure debugging through traceable test executions and streamlined, concise logging.
- Reduce duration of GitLab pipelines through selective test execution.
- Contribute quality tools to GitLab the product to help mature and dogfood our testing offerings.
- Increase MR Rate.

### Team Growth & Engagement
- Provide geo-diverse department activity and presence.
- Provide clear actionable career paths for all job families.
- Provide learning & growing opportunities for the management team.
- Collaborate with recruitment to ensure timely hiring.
- Every manager understands their team's MR Rate.

## How we Work

While this team operates as a several teams, we emphasize on ensuring the prioritization and needs of Engineering Leaders via stable counterparts.

### Stable counterparts

Every Software Engineer in Test (SET) takes part in building our product as a DRI in [GitLab's Product Quad DRIs](/handbook/product/product-processes/#pm-em-ux-and-set-quad-dris).
They work alongside Development, Product, and UX in the [Product Development Workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan).
As stable counterparts, SETs should be considered critical members of the core team between Product Designers, Engineering Managers and Product Managers.

- SETs should receive invites and participate in all relevant product group collaborations (meeting recordings, retro issues, planning issues, etc).
- SETs should operate proactively, not waiting for other stable counterparts to provide them direction.
The area a SET is responsible for is defined in the [Product Stages and Groups](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and part of their title.
- SETs meet with their counterpart Product Manager (PM), Engineering Manager (EM), Product Designer, and developers every month to discuss scheduling and prioritization.

Every Quality Engineering Manager (QEM) is aligned with an Engineering Director in the Development Department.
They work at a higher level and align cross-team efforts which maps to a [Development Department section](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy).
The area a QEM is responsible for is defined in the [Product Stages and Groups](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and part of their title.

### Milestone Planning

Milestones (product releases) are one of our [planning horizons](/handbook/product/product-processes/#planning-horizons), where prioritization is a collaboration between Product, Development, UX, and Quality. [DRIs](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) for prioritization are based on work type:

* Feature - PM
* Maintenance - EM
* Bug - QEM

We use [type labels](/handbook/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification) to track: feature, maintenance, and bug issues and MRs. UX Leadership are active participants in influencing the prioritization of all three work types.

QEMs meet with their PM, EM, and UX counterparts to discuss the priorities for the upcoming milestone. The purpose of this is to ensure that everyone understands the requirements and to assess whether or not there is the capacity to complete all of the proposed issues.

For product groups with a SET counterpart, QEMs are encouraged to delegate bug prioritization to the SET as the bug subject matter expert for that group. In these situations, QEMs should provide guidance and oversight as needed by the SET and should still maintain broad awareness of bug prioritization for these delegated groups.

While we follow the [product development timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline), it is recommended that you work with your counterparts to discuss upcoming issues in your group's roadmap prior to them being marked as a deliverable for a particular milestone. There will be occasions where priorities shift and changes must be made to milestone deliverables. We should remain flexible and understanding of these situations, while doing our best to make sure these exceptions do not become the rule.

### Work type trends

Section-level members of the quad are QEMs, Directors of Development, Directors of Product Management, and Product Design Managers aligned to the same section. These counterparts will review their work type trends on a monthly basis.

## Building as part of GitLab

- **GitLab features first**: Where possible we will implement the tools that we use as GitLab features.
- **Build vs buy**: If there is a sense of urgency around an area we may consider buying/subscribing to a service to solve our Quality challenges in a timely manner.
This is where building as part of GitLab is not immediately viable. An issue will be created to document the decision making process in our [team task](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks) issue tracker.
This shall follow our [dogfooding](/handbook/engineering#dogfooding) process.

## Processes

### General tips and tricks

We have compiled a number of tips and tricks we have found useful in day-to-day Quality Engineering related tasks.

For more information, please visit our [tips and tricks page](tips-and-tricks).

### On-call rotations

The Quality Engineering Sub-Department has two on-call rotations: pipeline triage (SET-led) and incident management (QEM-led). These are scheduled in advance to share the responsibilities of debugging pipeline failures and representing Quality in incident responses.

For more information, please visit our [on-call rotation page](oncall-rotation).

### Quad planning

The Quality Engineering Sub-Department helps facilitate the quad-planning process.
This is the participation of Product Management, Development, UX, and Quality which aims to bring test planning as a topic before the development of any feature.

For more information, please visit our [quad planning page](quad-planning).

### Borrow Request for SETs

A [borrow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#borrow) is used when a team member is shifted from one team to another temporarily or assists other teams part-time for an agreed-upon period of time.
Currently, we do not have an SET embedded within every product group, hence for product groups with no SET counterpart, the following would be the process to request one:

1. Create a [borrow request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Borrow-Request-Lite) with `~SET Borrow` label.
2. Based on the priorities, the request will be handled accordingly. 

Please note that the borrow request might not guarantee 100% allocation to the requested product group. The temporary allocation will depend upon ongoing priorities.

The list of all SET borrow requests can be seen [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=SET%20Borrow).

### Reliable tests

Reliable tests have met stricter reliability criteria than other tests in our test suite. When a failure is seen in a reliable test, it's less likely to be flakiness and more likely to be a true issue.

For more information, please visit our [reliable tests page](reliable-tests).

### Risk mapping

The Quality Engineering Sub-Department helps facilitate the risk mapping process. This requires the participation of Product Management, Development, UX, and the Quality team to develop a strategic approach to risk and mitigation planning.

For more information, please visit our [risk mapping page](risk-mapping).

### Test engineering

The Quality Engineering Sub-Department helps facilitate the test planning process for all things related to Engineering work.

For more information, please visit our [test engineering page](test-engineering).

### Test failures

If you need to debug a test failure, please visit our [debugging QA pipeline test failures page](debugging-qa-test-failures).

## ChatOps for Quality

The Quality Engineering Sub-Department maintains [ChatOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/chatops_on_gitlabcom.html) commands
for Quality department which provides quick access to various information on Slack. These commands can be run on any Slack channel that has
the GitLab ChatOps bot such as the [#quality](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C3JJET4Q6) and [#chat-ops-test](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=CB2S7NNDP) channels.

Commands that are currently available are:

| Command                              | Description |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `/chatops run quality dri schedule`  | Lists the current schedule for [on-call rotation](oncall-rotation) |
| `/chatops run quality dri report`    | Show current and previous Quality pipeline triage reports |
| `/chatops run quality dri incidents` | Lists currently active and mitigated incidents |

For more information about these commands you can run:

`/chatops run quality --help`

## Submitting and reviewing code

For test automation changes, it is crucial that every change is reviewed by at least one Senior Software Engineer in Test in the Quality team.

We are currently setting best practices and standards for Page Objects and REST API clients. Thus the first priority is to have test automation related changes reviewed and approved by the team.
For test automation only changes, the Quality Engineering Sub-Department alone is adequate to review and merge the changes.

## Weights

We use Fibonacci Series for weights and limit the highest number to 8. The definitions are as below:

| Weight | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1 - Trivial | Simple and quick changes (e.g. typo fix, test tag update, trivial documentation additions) |
| 2 - Small | Straight forward changes, no underlying dependencies needed. (e.g. new test that has existing factories or page objects) |
| 3 - Medium | Well understood changes with a few dependencies. Few surprises can be expected. (e.g. new test that needs to have new factories or page object / page components) |
| 5 - Large | A task that will require some investigation and research, in addition to the above weights (e.g. Tests that need framework level changes which can impact other parts of the test suite) |
| 8 - X-large | A very large task that will require much investigation and research. Pushing initiative level |
| 13 or more | Please break the work down further, we do not use weights higher than 8. |
