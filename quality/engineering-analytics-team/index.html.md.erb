## Mission

The goal of the team is to build and improve on the data capabilities needed to support a highly productive Engineering Division at GitLab. This team leverages our data analytics staffing and applies their efforts to the highest needs of Engineering.


## Vision

The engineering analytics team will enhance the metric capababilities of the engineering department by focusing on end user needs, cross-department collaboration, and industry best practices. 

Some things we will focus on include:
* Work with stable counterparts to provide actionable insights to yield better business outcomes
* Provide efficient data analytics and dashboarding capabilities on top of GitLab’s Data team warehouse infrastructure.
* Collaborating across departments to find common themes and find the best ways to represent similar metrics
* Propose new data and measurements to provide additional clarity to existing measurements.
* Analyze trends and propose strategic improvements to Engineering Leaders.
* Own creation, optimization and maintenance of the Engineering Division's and its departments' KPIs and PIs.
* Drive the creation, standardization, and implementation of all Engineering performance indicators.


## Strategy

Our plan to enable Engineering excellence in analytics is to:
* Focus on providing metrics that show a story that the users can act upon
* Narrow performance indicators to focus on most important metrics that track towards major themes of each department
* Support more efficient department key reviews with handbook driven performance indicators 
* Support stable counterpart departments with more granular & specific analysis that track towards day to day performance of the department towards its overall mission

## Team Responsibilities
The team works on the following items ordered by usual importance
* Support stable counterpart department with KPI/PI & other analysis
* Enable effective Engineering Department Key Reviews
* Support wider Eng Department with analysis & new metric requests


## Team Structure

This new team will be a new function under the Quality Department operating as a team of Data Analysts, led by an Engineering Manager reporting to the Quality Department Leader.

## How this team operates

While this team operates as a single team reporting to one manager, we emphasize on ensuring the prioritization and needs of Engineering Leaders via stable counterparts.

### Counterpart Assignments

We assign the stable counterpart by Engineering Division’s sub-departments. This is identified by the Engineering Department name assigned to an Analyst title. E.g. `Senior Data Analyst, Development`

| Engineering department | Data domains |
| ------ | ------ |
| `Development` | - MR Rate <br> - Code review/merge times <br> - Merge Request types <br> - Merge request activity and trends |
| `Infrastructure` | - Spend efficiency & forecasting <br> - MTTP <br> - MTTR <br> - Corrective actions & Incidents  <br> - Infrastructure product related metrics <br> - Finance Partnership <br> - [Roadmap](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/10/27/how-we-optimized-our-infrastructure-spend-at-gitlab/) |
| `Quality` | - Defect age <br> -  Bug SLO/SLA <br> - Defect rates <br> - Pipeline efficiency <br> - Issue & Merge Reques type  |
| `UX` | - UX debt age <br> - SUS Scores <br> - Refinement MR rate  |
| `Security` | - Security Vulnerabilities <br> - Security SLA |
| `Support` | - Ticket time to respond <br> - Ticket time to triage |

Data analysts assigned to one area are experts in that area and may not have the knowledge depth in other areas. As such contributing cross domain expertise will only be limited to Sisense charting and not beyond this data layer.

### Bi-weekly sync with assigned counterparts

The Data Analysts counterparts will have bi-weekly meetings with their designated department leader to:
* Review work prioritization
* Capture strategic asks
* Ensure completion of follow up for Key Review

### Weekly review with GitLab’s Data Team

This team will have standing weekly sync with the Data team to:
* Drive to resolution data dependencies
* Propose initiatives to improve our data accuracy and hygiene
* Improve our response time as a whole to our stakeholders
* Board and scheduling work
* This team will continue to use the [Engineering Metrics board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/boards/1942495) with DRIs in the team owning the tasks in the assigned counterpart areas in Engineering. 

### Stable Counterpart

The team structure will leverage [stable counterpart](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#stable-counterparts) assignees to ensure proper allocation and attention needed to service all Engineering Departments and Leaders and still promote cross-functional collaboration and ownership of an area.

### Common Responsibilities
In addition to the counterpart relationships, every data analyst on this team is responsible for:
* Operational excellence in Sisense dashboards
* Addressing data representation in-consistency/defects in a timely manner
* Metric representation consistency and ensuring our [guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/performance-indicators/#guidelines) are met
* Showcasing our work transparently to the world via our handbook.
* Improve our handbook pages iteratively, ensure that it’s up to date
