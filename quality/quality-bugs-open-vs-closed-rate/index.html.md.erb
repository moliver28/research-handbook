## Quality Bug Open vs Closed rate

> **Note::** This handbook page is only a temporary place for these charts. They will be moving to a [centralized location](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3580) along with other metrics that pertain to an engineering group.

These charts show the number of `bug` issues that are labelled `S1` or `S2` that are opened and closed within the same month, along with the net difference between the two counts.
