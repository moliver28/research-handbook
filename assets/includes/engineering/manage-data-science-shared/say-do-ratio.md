When we commit to a new milestone, engineering managers apply the ~Deliverable label to all issues they are able to commit to based on capacity. This serves as a promise from engineering to product as well as a signal for the most important issues in the milestone for the team to pick up. At the end of the milestone, successfully completed issues with the ~Deliverable label are assessed against the total number of ~Deliverable issues in order to create the Say/Do Ratio (7 issues completed of 10 committed to is a 70% Say/Do result.) 

The Say/Do Ratio is a metric used to:

- Provide predictability and stability when milestone planning
- Raise flags about the types of issues that are frequently disruptive
- Measure how well we are meeting our commitments to our customers
