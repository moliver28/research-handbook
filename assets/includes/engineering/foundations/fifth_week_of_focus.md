## Fifth week of focus

With our [release schedule](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline) our milestones are either four or five weeks long.
To make planning more predictable and encourage experimentation, we treat the fifth week of any longer milestone as a week of focus.
During this week, our engineers are encouraged to work on a project of their own choosing.
It could be starting a proof-of-concept, learning a new skill, burning down neglected issues, writing a blog post, or something else.
The only requirement is that it contributes to the team, or their personal development.

We trialled this as an [OKR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/5528) in December 2023 and it was a great success.

The upcoming five week milestones are:

- Aug 09, 2024 - Sep 13, 2024

- Jan 10, 2025 - Feb 13, 2025
