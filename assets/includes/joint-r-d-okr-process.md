## R&D OKR Overview

This page provides an overview of the joint R&D OKR workflow. All departments within R&D, which includes the [Product](/handbook/product/) and [Engineering](/handbook/engineering/) Divisions, collaborate by following this guidance. For clarifications on the OKR process, team members can post in Slack #product or #engineering-fyi.

## Timeline and process for OKRs

The OKR process is designed to tie in to the overall [OKR process](/handbook/company/okrs/#okr-process-at-gitlab) the company uses. That process is driven largely off of the date of the [Key Review](/handbook/company/key-review/) meetings, so the Product process keys off of that date as well. Dates will not necessarily align with the start of a fiscal quarter as a result.

### OKR Kick-off by Chief Product Officer

- **5 weeks** prior to the key review meeting, an [OKR progress document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1er_KodQAnxbvoy5ttyd_9A6XNlC9j-OvR85LYX6RbEI/edit) kicks off the OKR drafting process:
  - Product Program Management or their delegate creates an OKR progress Google document from the template which is used as a checklist for the combined R&D Leadership Teams (PLT + CTO LT). Relevant dates are updated in the template document.
- **4 weeks** prior to the key review meeting:
  - Chief Executive officer shared their OKRs with E-Group
  - Product Program Management shares the OKR progress document with the Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer.
  - Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer drafts R&D OKRs aligned to the [Yearlies](/handbook/company/yearlies/) and [Fiscal year product investment themes](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#fiscal-year-product-investment-themes) leveraging the Google progress document. This can be done async.
- **3 weeks** prior to the key review meeting:
  - Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology officer hold a sync 50m kickoff meeting:
    1. Share their insights on what they’d like us to accomplish in the quarter, given the Yearlies defined by E-Group (10m)
    1. A quick breakout session for each of the Product/Engineering LT counterpart groups to do initial brainstorming (20m)
    1. Come back as a group and compare notes / get quick feedback from the Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer (20m).
  - Product Program Management starts to put R&D OKRs in GitLab based on the progress document
  - Product/Engineering LTs iterate on OKRs (async)
- **2 weeks** prior to the key review meeting:
  - Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology officer review the proposed OKRs from teams and provide feedback (async)
  - Teams have a chance to iterate as needed until the Key Review deadline (one week prior to the Key Review)
  - Product Program Management finalizes R&D OKRs in GitLab and mentions `@gl-product-pm` (section, stage, and group product leads), `@gitlab-com/engineering-division/cto-leadership`, and/or post in the #product and #engineering-fyi Slack channels to finalize KR drafts with their respective [Quad](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/quad-planning/)
  - Leads from each section, stage, and group review R&D OKRs and provide feedback directly in GitLab on changes that may be needed.
  - Leads plan and propose their respective section, stage and section OKRs following the guidance on [how to write OKRs](/handbook/product/product-okrs/#how-to-write-okrs).
- **1 week** prior to key review meeting:
  - OKRs finalized and included in Key Review content (async)
- **Ongoing** after the key review meeting:
  - KR Owners update scores monthly
  - KR Owners [propose changes to OKRs as needed](#how-to-change-an-okr) at any point.

1. **2024-11-22**: Key Review (sync)

## Updating the Status and Progress of OKRs

### When to update the status of R&D OKRs

- For all R&D OKRs, the KR owners are responsible for keeping the status of their KRs in [GitLab](/handbook/company/okrs/#how-to-use-gitlab-for-okrs) up to date
  - Team members who **own** specific OKRs will update [the score (% complete) in GitLab](/handbook/company/okrs/#scoring-okrs) monthly and ping any relevant stakeholders as needed. For example, since Q1 begins February 1, KR owners will provide score updates by February 15,  March 15 and April 15. We follow this mid-month cycle to ensure there are accurate OKR status updates for [Key Reviews](/handbook/company/key-review/) which typically happen around the 20th of each month.
  - Update the OKR issue **whenever you have additional information** so that the status has the current state of the OKR.
- **Owners** of KRs will get pinged with reminders update their KRs through Slack around the 5th of each month.

#### How to report progress of R&D OKRs

- Prior to the key review meeting, shared R&D KR owners should lead and align on a plan for the R&D team to accomplish their KRs.
- For guidance on how to structure and score OKRs, refer to the [Scoring OKRs section](/handbook/company/okrs/#scoring-okrs) on the GitLab OKRs page.
- Before the next key review meeting, the OKR owner will do a final scoring of the OKRs. If the OKR shifted from the original OKR, always score the latest agreed to KRs that are still valid.

##### Scoring guidelines

To score KRs about improving from a **baseline metric** to a **new target metric**, score based on **progress from baseline to target metric**. For example, if baseline metric is 10, new target metric is 15, then the **target improvement** is 15-10 = 5. Every month calculate the improvement from baseline and divide it vs. the total target improvement (e.g. 15-10 or 5).

### Sharing OKR completion at the end of the quarter

During the first two weeks after the key review meeting, every R&D stage should complete an OKR retrospective leveraging the [Product OKR Retrospective template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Product-OKR-Retrospective). The retrospective DRI is the PM leading the stage. Beyond the stage members, the Product and Engineering lead of the section needs to be invited to the retrospective.

We recommend sharing the results of the retrospectives with `@gl-product-pm` and `@gitlab-com/engineering-division/cto-leadership` and other relevant stakeholders.

### How to change an OKR

In certain circumstances, it is appropriate to [change an OKR once started](/handbook/company/okrs/#making-changes-within-quarter). To make a change to an OKR:

1. OKR assignee review: The OKR assignee needs to review and agree to the proposed OKR change.
1. Tradeoffs review and communication: OKR assignee should ensure that the right tradeoffs are made to make the OKR feasible before the next key review meeting.
   1. If another OKR needs to be deprioritized this should be clearly outlined as part of the OKR change.
   1. If an OKR that needs to be deprioritized is a shared OKR, or a dependency for another team's work, the other teams and stakeholders must be informed of the change and their feedback considered.
1. Inform manager: As part of making the OKR change, the assignee should inform their manager and impacted stakeholders, including any owner of an objective that this OKR rolls up to and owners of OKRs below the one being changed.
1. Track the change and update the OKR: Once the manager and impacted stakeholders acknowledge the change, the assignee should:
   1. Update the description of the parent objective to add a summary of the change and link to the rationale. This helps keep track of OKR changes.
   1. Update the actual OKR in the GitLab OKR tracker to reflect the latest agreed to OKR.

## How to write OKRs

R&D groups should limit the number of OKRs they commit to so they have reasonable bandwidth to deliver. When planning OKRs:

1. Consider non-OKR commitments. While OKRs are the big commitments that the team is making, they [do not supersede core team members responsibilities](/handbook/company/okrs/#how-do-i-prioritize-okrs-in-light-of-other-priorities). For R&D, this means retaining team capacity beyond OKRs for work that falls higher in our [prioritization framework](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization-framework), such as forced prioritization items with an SLA/SLO. Meeting SLOs is not an OKR, as [OKRs focus on what's different](/handbook/company/okrs/#okrs-are-what-is-different).
   1. Other than core team member responsibilities such as those outlined above, all other major commitments should be prioritized through OKRs and consider team bandwidth.
   1. If a team gets a request for a major effort within the quarter, they can change the OKR by following the guidelines above about [how to change an OKR within the quarter](#how-to-change-an-okr-within-the quarter)
1. Plan for [OKRs to be ambitious, but achievable](/handbook/company/okrs/#criteria-for-key-results) within the team capacity that you have for OKRs. While OKRs are meant to be ambitious, [you should aim to complete them](/handbook/company/okrs/#how-do-i-prioritize-okrs-in-light-of-other-priorities) and strive to hit the ambitious plan. We recognize that with ambitious planning some OKRs will not be completed, but it is striving and reporting on OKRs with the goal of hitting 100% that helps us accomplish strong results. We score individual OKRs as "on track" when they are at least 80% complete. In aggregate, we expect that the average completion score across OKRs is 70%.
1. [Review cascading OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/#cascading-okrs-and-how-to-align-division-okrs-to-the-ceo-okrs) first and allocate time for those. Cascading OKRs are those at the CEO level or Product Division level that need your group's contributions to be achieved. You should prioritize these first.
1. It is OK to push back on OKRs. If you can't prioritize a cascading or shared OKR due to more important work, contact the owner of the OKR and make adjustments so that it is achievable without your team's contribution, or remove it. It is OK to do this, with clear communication and collaboration. It is not acceptable to simply ignore the cascading OKR or shared OKR without clear upfront communication and prioritize other work instead.
1. When writing OKRs, follow our company guidelines on [how to write OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/#how-to-write-okrs). In particular, focus on outcomes, not tasks, and make key results measurable.
1. For any OKR with a dependency, make sure to get [commitment on the dependency](/handbook/company/okrs/#dependency-commitments) with [shared objectives](/handbook/company/okrs/#shared-objectives). If you don't get commitment in the shared objective, make changes as needed to keep to feasible OKRs.

### Examples of good OKRs

**Objective: Establish GitLab leadership in X area.**

- Avoid ❌ KR1: GitLab X becomes available in beta, including Y functionality in beta, with a path to general availability next quarter.
- Instead ✅ KR1: GitLab X reaches 100k paid MAU by end of quarter.
- Avoid ❌ KR2: Ship 10 components to support the use of X.
- Instead ✅ KR2: 30% of GitLab users are able to use X with the components built.

This aligns with a focus on outcomes and business results instead of KRs tracking tasks or launches.

### Organizing R&D OKRs in GitLab

R&D Objectives and Key Results are drafted and entered into GitLab as per [Timeline and process for OKRs](#timeline-and-process-for-okrs). This includes all Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer level OKRs that R&D is tracking and reporting on. The R&D org as a whole encompasses many stages, groups, and teams. As a result, it can be challenging to track all OKRs in one place. As of FY25-Q4, we are using the following organizational structure to track our OKRs in GitLab:

- R&D OKRs (based on the Yearlies, combined top priority items across Dev, PM, UX, and QA) - assignees are the Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer
  - Objective/Yearly 1: [high priority item A]
    - KR1…
    - KR2…
  - Objective/Yearly 2: [high priority item B]
    - KR1…
    - KR2…
  - Objective/Yearly 3: [high priority item C]
    - KR1…
    - KR2…

Some specific guidance:

1. [Decide on an objective or key result](#deciding-between-an-objective-and-key-result-in-gitlab).
1. Title: Avoid adding a "FYXX-QX" prefix as it's indicated by the milestone.
1. Description:
    1. If a GitLab issue or epic exists, make sure to include a link to it.
    1. Mention [how the OKR is scored](#scoring-guidelines).
1. All other fields including assignee and labels: follow the [company guidance](/handbook/company/okrs/#how-to-use-gitlab-for-okrs).
1. If an O/KR are specific to one team it should still be prioritized across the overall set of priorities. This can be indicated using labels to differentiate.

### Deciding between an objective and key result in GitLab

Create a new or "child" objective if the OKR will be broken down further and will be scored based on its children (see next section). If there will be no children, create a key result.

If you're unsure, we recommend creating a child objective.
If an objective or key result needs to be changed to the other type, you will need to re-create it and delete the "old" work item.

This allows for a joint R&D rollup/scoring to take place while also allowing OKRs specific to a given Division to be tracked as well.

### Tracking department OKRs

As GitLab objectives can only have one parent, there are various options to track OKR progress for a specific department, sub-department, or team:

1. Track R&D aligned and non-R&D aligned OKRs separately, using assignee or label(s) to pull a list of all relevant objectives.
    - Example: [FY24-Q1 Customer Support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?state=all&milestone_title=FY24-Q1&label_name%5B%5D=Department%3A%3ACustomer%20Support)
1. Don't create department objectives and track on department KRs only. Recommend using a label to pull relevant KRs.
    - Example: [VP Development label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?state=all&milestone_title=FY24-Q1&label_name%5B%5D=vp-development)
1. Track only in linked epic or issue.
    - It is common that work is tracked in a `gitlab-org` issue or epic. While the OKR % needs to be updated in the OKR project, overview and all status updates could reside in the linked issue or epic.
