# OKRs

The source of truth for GitLab OKRs and KRs is the [GitLab OKRs tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=due_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Department%3A%3AInfrastructure%20%26%20Quality&label_name%5B%5D=OKR&label_name%5B%5D=division%3A%3AEngineering&first_page_size=20). Infrastructure & Quality objectives and KRs are captured on this page.
