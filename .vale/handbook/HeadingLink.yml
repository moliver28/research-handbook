# Error: handbook.HeadingLink
#
# Do not include a link in a heading.
# Headings already have self-referencing anchor links,
# and they're used for generating the table of contents.
# Adding a link will break the anchor linking behaviour.
#
# For a list of all options, see https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/
