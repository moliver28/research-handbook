## Wil's README

Hi there! I'm Wil, and I'm the head of social media at GitLab.

I've spent my career in and around full time social media roles in community, advertising, strategy, people management, and more. I've worked with B2B and B2C brands, from agency to brand side, with tech companies, restaurants, Fortune 500s, regulated industries, and may projects in between.

I think Darren, our head of remote, spoke about this use of our README pages on his page quite well. 
> This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven‚Äôt worked with me before. It's also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

## How does Social Media work?

Social Media is seen as "top of funnel" marketing for a lot of social activities, so our team focuses mainly on corporate level marketing, brand awareness tactics, and helping to make GitLab a loved brand in the marketplace. The execution of these activities can vary wildly from making a simple ["thank you" image to our community for growing over 10,000 meetup members](https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/1252664143187972099) to working on an integrated marketing campaign with social listening to drive content creation, a full calendar of posts, and post-campaign reporting.

Really, we operate most often as an internal agency partner to stakeholders around the company to find how organic social can fit into their work. Sometimes it's our brand channels, other times it's team members amplifying our message on their own channels. 

## What's my current role and goal?
As I lead social media at GitLab, ultimately everything I do is to better tie social media into our body of work as a company and to build a self-service culture of social media as a practice. What does that mean in real life? Sometimes it's bringing listening data to a call or a Slack chat that would otherwise not have had data to make decisions around, or it's when we're speaking in #HashtagsForCampaigns or #HashtagForEvents so that the practice becomes fluid. But most times, it shows up when our team brings our experiences and know-how for our everchanging channels to our larger marketing team, helping others to express their messages through social channels.

* I collaborate with every part of GitLab to better tell our story, share our message, and generate awareness.
* I help to build step-and-repeat practices and workflows to every area of the company social works with. 
* I educate team members on those same social practices, so that they can learn as much as possible through a self-service mindset.
* I help our team to remove obstacles, get to the simple solution, and keep us iterating further.
* And sometimes, I tweet. üòâ

## About me

* I've lived all over the United States: Wilmington, DE; Atlanta, GA; Los Angeles, CA; Orlando, FL; Stamford, CT; and Worcester, MA. A lot of these places were a part of a life of traveling for work, when I worked in the entertainment industry.
* I'm deeply committed to climate action on a global scale and believe it's the most important issue facing the planet. I've volunteered for many climate groups for different roles at different times. I trained under Al Gore to become a Climate Reality Leader in 2019 as a way jumpstart my involvement, but I'm still looking for my place in it all. 
* I grew up a major professional wrestling fan and worked my entire life to work for the largest wrestling company in the world. I ended up working for someone I admired and watched on television for 15 years. It was a lesson in learning about work styles, company culture and values, and realizing what was important to me.
* I also grew up very poor and generally disadvantaged, which gave me a lot of lessons about culture and heirarchy. So, I naturally find all authority figures untrustworthy and suspicious until I've built some rapport with them. This also means that I take my roles as an authority very seriously.

## How you can help me

* Be open to learning about social media beyond "pushing the Twitter button".
* Have a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action). Instead of waiting, move problems forward with a merge request or issue by default.  
* Connect the dots. Relate issues and merge requests to each other where applicable.
* I interpret silence as "everything is fine", if that's true, please reach out to me.
* Please try to avoid email. Most takeaways in email need to be translated into a GitLab issue or merge request, so start there if at all possible.
* I like explicit asks. ‚ÄúTake a look‚Äù is less helpful than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of month‚Äù. Help me understand the scope.
* I can't operate well without knowing "the why" behind actions and changes. It gives me air to breath when I understand why something is changing, moving, iterating in a particular why. Please try to include this when your explaining anything new to me.
* Operate using GitLab's [values](/handbook/values/) as your guide. If you notice me straying from our values, help me back on track.

## My working style

* [insert strength builders info]
* I believe in the power of [white space](https://jkglei.com/white-space/). I prefer time *after* a meeting to process and [document takeaways](/handbook/values/#write-things-down). I prefer time *before* a meeting to properly prepare and devote my full attention to the person or people who are being gracious with their time. 
* I have many strong opinions, but they‚Äôre [weakly held](https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/). I love finding a new perspective that makes me change my opinion, because it means that I‚Äôve gotten a chance to learn something substantive and new. This also means that I expect my working style will evolve over time. 
* I embrace [asynchronous workflows](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/). I prefer variety in my workday [as opposed to routine](/handbook/values/#responsibility-over-rigidity). I work best when leveraging a [non-linear workday](company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday/), maximizing daylight hours for exercising and being outdoors with my family. Some of my biggest breakthroughs came to me while scaling a mountainside, far from the reaches of an internet connection. None of my biggest breakthroughs came while sitting in an office, tethered to a string of pings and notifications. 

## What I assume about others

![GitLab all-remote mentor](/images/all-remote/ceo-shadow-gitlab-awesomeness.jpg){: .shadow.medium.center}

* [Positive intent](/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent). üòÅ
* You‚Äôre the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/). You‚Äôre better at your job than I am! You know best, and you‚Äôll tell me if there‚Äôs something preventing you from doing your best work possible.
  * If I ask you to own a project, even if it's funded entirely by my budget, it's because I trust your expertise. It's not a trap. I truly want you to control the destiny, as I believe you will do superior work in that area. I'm grateful for your genius and capabilities! 
  * If I disagree with you, I may try to steer you down a different path. But me disagreeing with you doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre doing something wrong as long as you‚Äôre [collaborating](/company/culture/all-remote/values/#collaboration) effectively with me and our teammates.
* You‚Äôll ask for my input and help if it‚Äôs needed. 
* You have more going on than the one thing we're discussing. 
* Work is absolutely not the most important thing in your life. I assume that there are [cherished relationships](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second) and personal interests that are more important to your happiness, and it‚Äôs hard to be happy with your job when work detracts from those things. 
* Everyone is likely fighting a battle I know nothing about. üíõ

## What I want to earn

* Your trust.
* Your psychological safety. I want to allow you the space to take risks, be vulnerable with me, and tell me when I could be doing something better.
* Your partnership. Life is more fun with community, working together to achieve common goals. 

## Communicating with me

* I tend to make suggestions and asks, rather than commands. 
  * This can make my input unclear. If I‚Äôm not communicating expectations effectively, please say so and I‚Äôll do my best to adjust my style. If I have a strong opinion about something, I will say so.
* I try to express gratitude frequently. This is genuine.
* I try to be a structured communicator and thinker, but sometimes start to speak in an unstructured way when I get excited about something, when I'm on the go, or when I'm crunched for time.
  * Please interject if you‚Äôre not getting what you want out of me.
  * Brevity does not equate to being rude, short, or perturbed. 
* Please do not take offense to periods of silence. I prefer long, uninterrupted windows of time for [deep work](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#mental-health). I disable **all** notifications on my Mac and everything but iMessage on my phone. This allows me to focus deeply on one task at a time, which is a more [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency) way of working than attempting to [multitask](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1589-multitasking-is-the-fastest-way-to-mediocrity). In return, I will devote my full attention to your request and respond thoughtfully, with context and passion. 
* Unless specifically mentioned, I don‚Äôt expect immediate responses from anyone. I [respect others‚Äô time](/handbook/communication/#be-respectful-of-others-time) and want you to have the space for a thoughtful response.
