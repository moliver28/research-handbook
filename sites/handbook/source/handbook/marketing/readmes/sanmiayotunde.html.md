## Sanmi (pronounced "Sun-Me") Ayotunde Ajanaku's README

Hi there! I'm **Sanmi**, my name is not that complicated, it's pronounced as **"sun-me"**, which means "Favored by God".  I am a Frontend Engineer at GitLab, and you will love working with me.

I started my career as a graphics designer for my Dad's printing company at the age of 11. This developed my strange passion for computers and self-learning. I have spent all my life self-learning, even though I have a Bachelors in Computer Science, but my quest for knowledge and programming is unsatiable.

I've spent my career in and around web development, mobile app development, startups, advertising, strategy, people management, and customer journey transformation.  Having worked with my own startups, African based startups,  B2B and B2C companies in the United States, with manufacturing companies, Fortune 500s, and even small local owned businesses such as restaurants and other micro-businesses, I have developed a taste of understanding what users want online and how to give it to them easily and quickly.

## What's my current role and goal?

I develop web applications, components, contents, and anything you can click and interact with on web application ... I understand you want to know more, stay calm ...
* I will be updating this section soon. ðŸ˜‰
