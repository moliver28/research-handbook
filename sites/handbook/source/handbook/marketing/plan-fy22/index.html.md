## GTM Motions
{: #gtm-motions .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

The GTM motions were built by CMO staff, and then evangelized with both product & sales leadership for feedback. Each motion describes the WHY behind why it was included as a GTM Motion, as well as related sales plays and alliance partners to leverage in the motion.

To view the GTM Motions Googlesheet, please go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) and search for `GTM Motions FY22 Marketing Plan`. You may also view the embedded sheet below.

</figure>

The GTM Motions each include a [Core Team](), comprised of funcational DRIs for subject-matter specific teams within marketing. If your specific group is not listed as a Core Team, don't worry! Each team and each individual in Marketing plays an integral role in making the FY22 Marketing Plan a reality and a success. Pease see more information in [GTM Motion Core Teams]() and [Beyond the GTM Motion Core Teams]() below.

All marketing team members should plan to focus ~70% of their time and plan around these GTM motions, allowing for ~30% of their time to be spent testing new messaging that's not a GTM motion. 

## GTM Motion Core Teams
{: #core-teams .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

* The Core Team's purpose is to collaborate on the research, positioning, messaging, general strategy, and overall timeline of the GTM Motion and included Sales Plays
* The Core Teams are comprised of functional DRIs from teams aligned to product specializations (SMEs within their teams)
* The Core Teams will determine a relevant and realistic timeline in line with overarching marketing themes, and including Sales Plays
* The Core Teams will kickoff together with the freedom to drive their GTM Motions as desired and with a strong team-oriented approach
* The Core Teams will be responsible for ensuring proper communication of plans to all of Marketing (see [Core Team Communication](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22#core-team-communications))

### Beyond the GTM Motion Core Teams
{: #beyond-core-teams}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

**All teams play an *INTEGRAL* role in reaching our marketing goals, regardless if they are on the Core Team or not.** Differences in team alignment (i.e. to segment/region) and approaches that will span and leverage all GTM Motions, are two reasons for teams being beyond the Core Teams.

If your team or name is not listed as part of the core team, don't worry! As part of this FY22 Marketing Plan, a keen focus is alignment and ensuring everyone across marketing is connected and collaborating. **If you would like to participate on a Core Team, you may do so - connect with the Core Team of interest to learn more about getting involved!** Anyone joining a Core Team will be expected to be an active contributor and participant.

### Core Team Communication
{: #core-team-communication}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

How to keep all teams in the loop will be a key responsibility of the Core Teams. Continual communication of plans, progress, and how to leverage the GTM Motion collateral will be a key to success in the FY22 Marketing Plan.

The teams are encouraged to contribute ideas and processes for communication here in the handbook throughout FY22.

### Interlocked Teams
{: #interlocked-teams}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

To be built upon through FY22, this section will be comprised of process related to collaboration and commitment (making sure nobody burns out, and we all run in the same direction).

### GTM 4x2 - Strategy by Sales Segment
{: #gtm-4x2}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

The 4X2 goes into detail about differences in go-to-market by sales segment (Large, Mid-Market, SMB, and PubSec). The 4x2 includes overall business flows, new business motion overivew, key measurements, and team-specific roles in the segment-specific GTM strategies.

To view the GTM 4x2 Googlesheet, please go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) and search for `GTM Motion Strategy Template (4x2)`.

<!-- Need more background here -->

## Sales Plays
{: #sales-plays .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Sales Plays combine buyer personas, positioning, and messaging, integrated into go-to-market activities in an organized collaboration with sales. This can include target account lists, key contacts data, call guides, outreach sequences, SDR enablememt, sales play training, and more - what is included is to be determined by the Core Teams working on the sales plays.

As Sales Plays are developed, the combination of the Sales Plays for a motion will develop a GTM Motion Playbook to be leveraged by Sales and SDRs.

To see the planned Sales Plays, see **column C** in [GTM Motions](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22#gtm-motions).

## Themes
{: #themes .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Themes will help us build a more cohesive story-telling approach, leveraging the GTM Motions and unifying our activities and messaging. Pulling together collective brainpower across the marketing teams and highlighting opportunities to leverage each team's plans and ideas will help to define our FY22 themes.

Themes are expected to be generated through the Core Team planning in kicking off the GTM Motions (all teams are welcome and encouraged to contribute to theme generation!)

*For example, if we want to celebrate our alliance partners in a specific month, we can identify that as a theme and determine how all teams can contribute to the plan and deliver a cohesive and organized approach.*

## Project Compass
{: #project-compass .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

To view the Project Compass Googlesheet, please go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) and search for `Project Compass: Implementation - Sales & Marketing Levers`.

**Marketing Focus in Project Compass:**
* Improve SEO through content mktg. and website improvements
* Scale ABM program to include more enterprise accounts
* Expand email marketing campaigns
â€©* Engage referral partners to drive web traffic (e.g., Stack Overflow)
* Improve inquiry to SAO conversion reducing drop-offs (Specifically, MQL to SAO conversion)

## Team-specific commentary on the GTM Motions

### Field Marketing
{: #commentary-field-marketing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
As a Field Marketer, you will be leveraging the GTM Motions in your regional strategy and plans*. You may detemine that a certain GTM Motion will be more heavily leveraged in your region and/or help you reach your regional goals, and you are interested in joining the Core Team for that GTM Motion. Or perhaps you have a particular passion for a specific GTM Motion and want to be an active participant and contributor to the Core Team or a sepcific Sales Play. Great! Connect with the Core Team to get involved.

*You do not have to use all GTM Motions and you may go outside of these GTM Motions, although, as mentioned in the GTM Motions section, ~70% of your time should be spent focusing on the GTM Motions.

### Campaigns Team
{: #commentary-campaigns-team}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
As a Campaign Manager, you have a challenge on your plate: to plan and report from the perspective of GMT Motions, AND to plan/reort from the perspective of your segment/region to ensure lead flow aligned to sales targets is on track. You will be an active contriutor to a Core Team by sharing insight into existing data from the GTM Motions to-date; organizing and communicating existing buyer journeys, content, and nurture emails; and strategizing/communicating top funnel activities for FY22.

You will be expected to become a subject matter expert of the GTM Motion as a Core Team member and ensure the Demand Generation team is up-to-date with what is planned for the GTM Motion (so that team members can best leverage the GTM Motions within their top-funnel campaign plans by segment/region.

## Project Management
{: #project-management .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

The GTM Motions will each have an epic, where all teams can reference plans and the issues (i.e. action items) to accomplish the plans.
