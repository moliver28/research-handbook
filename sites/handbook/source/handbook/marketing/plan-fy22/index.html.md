* Tiemline: Ensure marketing alignment by end of February 2021
* Measure: how do we confirm everyone is aligned?

At their simplist form, the GTM motions were built by CMO staff, and then evangelized with both product & sales leadership before we landed on the GTM motions. Each motion has the WHY included, as well as related sales plays and alliance partners. 

The GTM Motions are comprised of a `core team` which is really meant to be the DRIs for each respective team within marketing. If your specific group is not listed as a `core team` you are still able, and you may be asked to join that team to support. 

All marketing team members should focus ~70% of their time and plan around these GTM motions, allowing for ~30% of their time to be spent testing new messaging that's not a GTM motion. 

While we do have the marketing calendar set (link to marketing cal section), it is up to the GTM core team to create a timeline for their specific motion and to plan in sales plays that align to the motion. 

#### Team specific commentary on the GTM Motions 
Each team leader or team member should feel empowered to add to this section, providing examples and thoughts for colleagues. 

##### Field Marketing 
As a Field Marketer, if you would like to join a GTM Motion Core team, you may. You may choose to this because you are passionate about a certain GTM Motion or feel that you being as close as possible (therefore joining the team) will help you reach your regional goals. You may also choose to align your campaigns to the Core Motions and by doing so, you'll have the confidence that top of funnel leads should be coming in through these campaigns, and your campaigns will be well equipped to further progress the leads. You'll also have confidence that the email nurtures and the sales plays are being created and updated. 

You do not have to use all GTM Motions and you may go outside of these GTM Motions, although, as mentioned in the GTM Motions section, ~70% of your time should be spent focusing on the GTM Motions. 

##### Campaigns

## How our motions are leveraged with sales segmentation

In FY22 we will still have Campaign Managers and Field Marketing Managers who have both a specific geo and segment focus. The 4X2 goes into further detail into how we see segment differences at GitLab.
