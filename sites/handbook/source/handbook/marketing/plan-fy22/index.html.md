## GTM Motions

At their simplist form, the GTM motions were built by CMO staff, and then evangelized with both product & sales leadership before we landed on the GTM motions. Each motion has the WHY included, as well as related sales plays and alliance partners. 

The GTM Motions are comprised of a `core team` which is really meant to be the DRIs for each respective team within marketing. If your specific group is not listed as a `core team` you are still able, and you may be asked to join that team to support. 

All marketing team members should focus ~70% of their time and plan around these GTM motions, allowing for ~30% of their time to be spent testing new messaging that's not a GTM motion. 

While we do have the marketing calendar set (link to marketing cal section), it is up to the GTM core team to create a timeline for their specific motion and to plan in sales plays that align to the motion. 

## GTM Motion Core Teams
{: #gtm-core-teams .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

* The GTM Motion Core Team's purpose is to collaborate on the research, positioning, messaging, general strategy, and overall timeline of the GTM Motion and included Sales Plays
* The Core Teams are comprised of functional DRIs from teams aligned to product specializations (SMEs within their teams)
* The Core Teams will kickoff together with the freedom to drive their GTM Motions as desired and with a strong team-oriented approach!

### Beyond the GTM Motion Core Teams
{: #beyond-core-teams}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

**All teams play a *CRUIAL* role in reaching our marketing goals, regardless if they are on the Core Team or not.** Differences in team alignment (i.e. by region) and approaches that we anticipate to span/leveraging all GTM Motions, are two reasons for teams being outside of the Core Team.

If your team or name is not listed as part of the core team, don't worry! As part of this FY22 Marketing Plan, a keen focus is alignment and ensuring everyone across marketing is connected and collaborating. **If you would like to participate on a Core Team, you may do so - connect with the Core Team of interest to learn more about getting involved!** Anyone joining a Core Team will be expected to be an active contributor and participant.

### Core Team Communication
{: #core-team-communication}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

How to keep all teams in the loop will be a key responsibility of the Core Teams. Continual communication of plans, progress, and how to leverage the GTM Motion work will be a key to success in the FY22 Marketing Plan.

The teams are encouraged to contribute ideas and processes for communication here in the handbook throughout FY22.

### Interlocked Teams
{: #interlocked-teams}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Process of planning and having conversations around collaboration and commitment (make sure nobody burns out, and we all run in the same direction).

## Team-specific commentary on the GTM Motions
{: #team-commentary .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
Team leaders and team members should feel empowered to add to this section, providing examples and thoughts for colleagues. 

### Field Marketing
{: #commentary-field-marketing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
As a Field Marketer, you will be leveraging the GTM Motions in your regional strategy and plans*. You may detemine that a certain GTM Motion will be more heavily leveraged in your region and/or help you reach your regional goals, and you are interested in joining the Core Team for that GTM Motion. Or perhaps you have a particular passion for a specific GTM Motion and want to be an active participant and contributor to the Core Team or a sepcific Sales Play. Great! Connect with the Core Team to get involved.

*You do not have to use all GTM Motions and you may go outside of these GTM Motions, although, as mentioned in the GTM Motions section, ~70% of your time should be spent focusing on the GTM Motions.

<!-- Jackie: I think it would be more positive to address the confidence thing in a different way. It feels like it sets the wrong tone, but indicated something that we should definitely address in roll-out which is communication - I added a section above regarding the responsibility of the core team to communicate plans, progress, and how to leverage the work. "You may also choose to align your campaigns to the Core Motions and by doing so, you'll have the confidence that top of funnel leads should be coming in through these campaigns, and your campaigns will be well equipped to further progress the leads. You'll also have confidence that the email nurtures and the sales plays are being created and updated." -->

### Campaigns Team
{: #commentary-campaigns-team}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
As a Campaign Manager, you have a challenge on your plate: to plan and report from the perspective of GMT Motions, AND to plan/reort from the perspective of your segment/region to ensure lead flow aligned to sales targets is on track. You will be an active contriutor to a Core Team by sharing insight into existing data from the GTM Motions to-date; organizing and communicating existing buyer journeys, content, and nurture emails; and strategizing/communicating top funnel activities for FY22.

You will be expected to become a subject matter expert of the GTM Motion as a Core Team member and ensure the Demand Generation team is up-to-date with what is planned for the GTM Motion (so that team members can best leverage the GTM Motions within their top-funnel campaign plans by segment/region.

## How our motions are leveraged with sales segmentation
{: #motions-and-segmentation}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

In FY22 we will still have Campaign Managers and Field Marketing Managers who have both a specific geo and segment focus. The 4X2 goes into further detail into how we see segment differences at GitLab. 

<!-- Note: Add 4x2 here? Or in the top section? -->
