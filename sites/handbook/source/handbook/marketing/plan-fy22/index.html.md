### Purpose of this Handbook Page: align our marketing teams on a single FY22 marketing plan

### Goal of FY22 Marketing Plan:
    - 
    - simplify motions
    - increase collaboration
    - develop interlocked teams
    - provide leadership opportunities
* Audience: Marketing (not sales, etc.)
* Timeline: have everyone aligned by end of February
* Measure: how do we confirm everyone is aligned? (ideally use gitlab in some way)
