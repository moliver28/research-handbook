## Jump to [Sales Play Tactics](#sales-play-tactics)

## Overview

**Objective**

Convert landed accounts that are already using CI/CD to expand from GitLab Premium to GitLab Ultimate. 

Who is this sales play for?  
* Primary: SALs and AEs who call on one or more existing GitLab Premium customers  
* Secondary: SAs and TAMs who support one or more existing GitLab Premium customers  

Note: This play is FYI only for SDRs because it is upselling tiers, not necessarily expanding seats.

## Who to meet

**Ideal Customer Profile**  

Existing GitLab Premium customers already using CI/CD
- Bonus points for:
   - Organizations at lower maturity level undergoing or planning to undergoing tranformation
   - Siloed teams with disparate tools, especially security, lacking visibility at the individual level and executive level
   - Organizations with stringent regulatory security or compliance requirements

**Target Buyer Personas**

Economic buyers: CISO or Security Manager, VP of Security, Director of Security, VP of IT or CTO, App/Dev Director

Technical influencers: Chief Architect, App Dev Manager

Other Personas to consider: Infrastructure Engineering Director, Release and Change Management Director

**Target Account Lists** 

[Account list](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004akG8) 

## Getting Started

Consider the following questions: 
* What has prevented the customer from moving to (or considering moving to) GitLab Ultimate?
* Does the customer have any strategic initiative or priority to which upgrading to Ultimate would align nicely?
* Are you engaged with the right personas/teams (see Target Buyer Personas above)?
* Do you have access to power/authority (a business decision maker)?
* Who are your champions within the account?
* Are the capabilities and PBOs that are enabled by GitLab Ultimate important to the customer? Why or why not? How do you know?
 
## Value Discovery

Note: as we iterate, we can use [these DevSecOps disovery questions for MVC1](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#discovery-questions) and then change the resource pages to the suggested format

**Common Pains**  

GitLab Premium customers may be experiencing one or more of the below challenges:

| Challenges ("Before Scenarios")  | So What? ("Negative Consequences")  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| challenge 1    | negative cons 1 |
| challenge 2    | negative cons 2 |
| challenge 3    | negative cons 3 |

**Common Benefits**  

By upgrading from GitLab Premium to GitLab Ultimate, customers may experience one or more of the below benefits:

| Desired Future State (“After Scenarios”) | So What? (“Positive Business Outcomes”)   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| item 1    | item 1 |
| item 2    | item 2 |
| item 3    | item 3 |

**Required Capabilities**  

To achieve the positive business outcomes highlighted above, what required capabilities does the customer need to solve for and how will success be measured?

| item 1    | item 1 |

## Engaging the Customer

Note: maybe we use [this link as mvc1](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#discovery-questions) and then change the resource pages to the suggested format?

| Questions to Better Understand the Customer’s needs  | Discovery questions  |

| future state    | questions 1, 2,3 |

## Positioning Value 

**How GitLab Does It**

[How GitLab meets the market requirements for security](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#how-gitlab-meets-the-market-requirements)

**How GitLab Does It Better** 

Note: suggested format has Differentiators and Benefits followed by Proof Points while the resource page has differentiator, value, proof point, demo. I propose we leave the summary here but link to the resource page as mvc1. For mvc2 we can reformat the resource page (if needed).

With GitLab Ultimate, organizations are able to truly shift security left (and right!) to reduce exposure and align security with dev. Emergent advantages include unparalleled visibility and insights and much easier traceability with consistent compliance to policies or regulatory requirements for cleaner, easier audits.
