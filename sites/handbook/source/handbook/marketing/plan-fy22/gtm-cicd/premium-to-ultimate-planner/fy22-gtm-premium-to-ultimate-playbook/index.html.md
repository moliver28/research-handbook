title: "FY22 GTM Sales Play - Premium to Ultimate"
---
## Context (campaign promise/offer) 

Objective to convert landed accounts that are already using CI/CD to expand from premium to ultimate. This play is fyi only for SDRs because it is upselling tiers, not necessarily expanding seats.

* [SKO Expanding to Ultimate](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oq7ODy9TJpuZqH_tvVtCm2t-C0QkTbuG4ZRlRzRNcUY/edit#slide=id.gb4749ff26b_0_85)
* [Selling security]() see John Blevin's online classroom material
* [Selling DevSecOps](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#ultimate)

Marketing is targeting a campaign at [these accounts](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004akG8) (as of 2021-03-22) XYZ persona will receive [this email]() inviting them to [zzz web page]()  (or collateral or offer). (See [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1901)for details.)

Emphasis on large due to the relation to verticals + regulated industries, but all should be included.

**Key messages used in the campaign**

[Placeholder for link to message house](link-to-add)

* ENT: GitLab unifies teams together across the entire SDLC regardless of role - product managers, designers, developers, managers, and all roles in between, can work more efficiently and stay involved as a part of a single conversation across the SDLC. Helps enterprises create products relevant for customers, go to market faster and beat the competition while staying secure and compliant. 
* MM: Improve efficiencies, collaboration, and eliminate bottlenecks. Spend time on planned work instead of maintaining and integrating tools. Get expertise and support that assures you can meet your strategic goals along the way
* SMB: Set yourself up for long term success and keep your developers happy - code reviews, source control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment all tied together and all roles can speak the same language. Start right before inefficiencies get in the way of scaling out successfully
* PubSec:  Manage risk from security and regulatory compliance by identifying vulnerabilities and compliance issues before the code ever leaves the developer's hands. Stop worrying about audits!

1.  Gartner MQ for AST expected in May 2021
1.  new Gartner MQ for Plan

And these **customer stories**: (reevaluate if these are still the best ones for Plan & Secure)
* ~20 tools consolidated into GitLab; Glympse remediated security issues faster than any other company in their Security Auditor's experience

Development can move much faster when engineers can stay on one page and click buttons to release auditable changes to production and have easy rollbacks; everything is much more streamlined. Within one sprint, just 2 weeks, Glympse was able to implement security jobs across all of their repositories using GitLab’s CI templates and their pre-existing Docker-based deployment scripts.

* Jenkins build took 3 hours, now with GitLab it takes 30 mins: a 6x improvement

GitLab has allowed Alteryx to have code reviews, source control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment all tied together and speaking the same language. The team took a build that was running legacy systems and moved it to GitLab. This build took 3 hours on the Jenkins machine and it took 30 minutes to run on GitLab after it was going. Engineers can actually look at the build and understand what’s going on; they’re able to debug it and make it successful

* BI Worldwide performed 300 SAST/Dependency scans in the first 4 days of use helping the team identify previously unidentified vulnerabilities

One tool for SCM+CI/CD was a big initial win. Now wrapping security scans into that tool as well has already increased our visibility into security vulnerabilities. The integrated Docker registry has also been very helpful for us. Issue/Product management features let everyone operate in the same space regardless of role.

   * Consistent compliance to policy, for cleaner and easier audits 
* Leading SCM, CI, and code review in one
   * Completely integrated from idea to production
   * No plugins, etc.
* Transparent and collaborative
   * Single source of truth with built-in collaboration to focus on remediation, less friction
