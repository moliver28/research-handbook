And these **customer stories**: (reevaluate if these are still the best ones for Plan & Secure)
* ~20 tools consolidated into GitLab; Glympse remediated security issues faster than any other company in their Security Auditor's experience

Development can move much faster when engineers can stay on one page and click buttons to release auditable changes to production and have easy rollbacks; everything is much more streamlined. Within one sprint, just 2 weeks, Glympse was able to implement security jobs across all of their repositories using GitLab’s CI templates and their pre-existing Docker-based deployment scripts.

* Jenkins build took 3 hours, now with GitLab it takes 30 mins: a 6x improvement

GitLab has allowed Alteryx to have code reviews, source control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment all tied together and speaking the same language. The team took a build that was running legacy systems and moved it to GitLab. This build took 3 hours on the Jenkins machine and it took 30 minutes to run on GitLab after it was going. Engineers can actually look at the build and understand what’s going on; they’re able to debug it and make it successful

* BI Worldwide performed 300 SAST/Dependency scans in the first 4 days of use helping the team identify previously unidentified vulnerabilities

One tool for SCM+CI/CD was a big initial win. Now wrapping security scans into that tool as well has already increased our visibility into security vulnerabilities. The integrated Docker registry has also been very helpful for us. Issue/Product management features let everyone operate in the same space regardless of role.
