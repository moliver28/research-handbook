## Jump to [Sales Play Tactics](#sales-play-tactics)

## Overview

**Objective** - . 

Who is this sales play for?

* Secondary: SALS, AEs, TAMs calling on existing customers and looking to broaden adoption by new roles

## Who to meet

**Ideal Customer Profiles**  
- Transformation-minded leaders

- Bonus points for:
   - Heavy focus on cross-team collaboration
   - Multiple roles being filled by individual contributors (e.g., needing to jump from development to security or product manager to tester)
   - Multiple-vendor DevOps toolchain in place
   - Existing resources already assigned to integration and maintenance

**Target Buyer Personas**

| Persona role  | Possible titles|
| ------------- |:----------------------:| 
| Economic buyers    | Head of Product, CTO, CIO, CISO, VP / Director of App Development |
| Technical influencers    | Chief Architect, App Dev Manager, DevOps Engineer | 
| Other Personas to consider | PMO, Release & Change Management |


**Target Account Lists** 

- [Account list](TBD)

## Getting Started

Consider the following questions: 
* Does the organization have any strategic transformation initiatives that could benefit from a single platform for collaboration?
* Is there existing interdepartmental friction brought about by differently aligned priorities? 
* Is the customer already managing multiple tools in a toolchain?
* Is the customer early in their agile journey and seeking guidance on the best path forward?
* Are you engaged with the right personas/teams (see Target Buyer Personas above)?
* Do you have access to power/authority (a business decision maker)?
* Who are your champions within the account?
 
## Value Discovery


### Common Pains  

An in-depth view of pain points and probing questions around them can be found on the [DevOps Platform resource page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devops-platform/#current-state-wheres-the-pain)


### Common Benefits  

By adopting GitLab's DevOps Platform, customers may experience one or more of the below benefits:

| Desired Future State (“After Scenarios”) | So What? (“Positive Business Outcomes”)   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Seamless collaboration across entire SDLC.   | Complete context always available to any stakeholder, resulting in less misalignment of work, less context switching, and greater ability to execute quickly and independently. |
| No integrations to create or maintain. | Staff can spend more time creating value, rather than managing infrastructure. Increased visibility across toolchain in the absence of API "chokepoints" between tools.  |
| End-to-end traceability from discussion, to code, to review, to test and deploy.   | Painless audits, easy-to-understand forensic analysis to improve value flow and training. |
| Complete suite of DevSecOps functionality available out-of-the-box | Predictable costs, even as needs evolve. Users more likely to partake of security and compliance features if they are readily available.  |
| A single application with a single UX   | Reduce training costs and ramp time, increases ability of staff to move between roles and teams |


### Required Capabilities  

To achieve the positive business outcomes highlighted above, what required capabilities does the customer need to solve for and how will success be measured?

| Required capability |  Customer Metrics  |

## Objection handling


**Most common objections**

| Objection  | Response    |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| "I don't want to rip and replace my toolchain." | There's no need to do a rip-and replace. GitLab can coexist with any number of tools for as long as you need. You can start small on a green field project and prove out the value of GitLab before adopting more widely. If you have a tool you just can't move for now, simply integrate it, use GitLab for the rest, and consider replacing the legacy tool in the futre if that's right for you.  |
| "We've spent a lot of time building/customizing/tuning _product x_."   | What if you could stop spending that effort on tool maintainence and spend it instead on delivering higher quality software faster? |
| "We have very specialized DevOps needs." | We've developer a true DevOps Platform. That means you can build on it easily if you need to, either through our [many integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/), or by [contributing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/) to our [open source cor](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/07/20/gitlab-is-open-core-github-is-closed-source/)e. You probably won't need to, however. [Our customers](https://about.gitlab.com/customers/) have very specific and demanding requirements, and we've been able to meet them. |
| "I'm not going to use all of it." | You don't need to use everything GitLab has to offer, but it will always be available to you,and since we're a true platform delivered as a single application, adding new features when you're ready is really just as easy as pushing a button. We have thousands of customers who started with just one or two features and adopted the entire solution because it was more cost effective and simpler to maintain. |
