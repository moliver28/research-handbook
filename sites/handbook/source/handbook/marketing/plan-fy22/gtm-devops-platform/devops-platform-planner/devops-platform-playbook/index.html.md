## Jump to [Sales Play Tactics](#sales-play-tactics)

## Overview

**Objective** - . 

Who is this sales play for?

* Secondary: SALS, AEs, TAMs calling on existing customers and looking to broaden adoption by new roles

## Who to meet

**Ideal Customer Profiles**  
- Transformation-minded leaders
- Management personas interested in greater efficiency

- Bonus points for:
   - Heavy focus on cross-team collaboration
   - Multiple roles being filled by individual contributors (e.g., needing to jump from development to security or product manager to tester)
   - Multiple-vendor DevOps toolchain in place
   - Existing resources already assigned to integration and maintenance

**Target Buyer Personas**

| Persona role  | Possible titles|
| ------------- |:----------------------:| 
| Economic buyers    | Head of Product, CTO, CIO, CISO, VP / Director of App Development |
| Technical influencers    | Chief Architect, App Dev Manager, DevOps Engineer | 
| Other Personas to consider | PMO, Release & Change Management |


**Target Account Lists** 

- [Account list](TBD)

## Getting Started

Consider the following questions: 
* Does the organization have any strategic transformation initiatives that could benefit from a single platform for collaboration?
* Is there existing interdepartmental friction brought about by differently aligned priorities? 
* Is the customer already managing multiple tools in a toolchain?
* Is the customer early in their agile journey and seeking guidance on the best path forward?
* Are you engaged with the right personas/teams (see Target Buyer Personas above)?
* Do you have access to power/authority (a business decision maker)?
* Who are your champions within the account?

## Engaging the Customer

Note: maybe we use [this link as mvc1](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#discovery-questions) and then change the resource pages to the suggested format?

| Questions to Better Understand the Customer’s needs  | Discovery questions  |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| current state    | 1. How far along are you in your DevOps journey?<br>2. What / how many DevOps tools are you using today?<br>3. How do you involve business stakeholders in your DevOps process?<br>4. How important are audits and compliance? |
| future state    | 1. In an ideal world, what would collaboration look like in your organization?<br>2. What challenges do you have with your existing tools and can you predict their cost 2 years out?<br>3. Are there things you'd like to do with DevOps but complexity is holding you back? |
| Required capabilities   | 1. What if your security teams, business stakeholders, and others had access to all the information they needed on-demand?<br>2. What would you do if you could reclaim the time you spend integrating and maintaining your DevOps toolchain?<br>3. What if you could track all your discussions, the code changes that resulted from them, the performance and security impact of those changes, and all the collaboration around them--in one place, automatically? |

Note TBD: When sales gets the lead, will it show from which email it came? If so, sales will want to align the meeting purpose to the CTA from which the lead came. If sales will not see from which email the lead came, they can choose where in this flow is most appropriate to begin.

1. **Initial qualification meeting 1** - use #value-discovery above to assess business objectives. Use these recommended assets based upon areas of most interest:
   * Cost and/or complexity⇒ use ROI template (link) discussion   
   * vulnerabilities/risk ⇒  security deck (link) as preface to next mtg  
   * compliance/software supply chain security ⇒ compliance deep dive deck (TBD as preface to next mtg (will have a [new webinar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/account-based-strategy/account-based-marketing/-/issues/573) May 24  
**Milestones:** Identify key value driver, champion, and economic buyer, agree to second meeting  
**Metric:** Sales Accepted Opp
