## Engaging the Customer

Note: maybe we use [this link as mvc1](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#discovery-questions) and then change the resource pages to the suggested format?

| Questions to Better Understand the Customer’s needs  | Discovery questions  |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| current state    | 1. Are you wanting to shift security left? How is that going?<br>2. What security tools are you using today?<br>3. Are you confident you can secure containers and Kubernetes?|
| future state    | 1. What if you could simplify your shift-left efforts?<br>2. What challenges do you have with your existing tools and can you predict their cost 2 yrs out?<br>3. Would you like to better protect containers and K8s? |
| Required capabilities   | 1. Could security integrated into CI help you get there?<br>2. What if you had one, known cost that enabled ALL your security scans, with results to the developer in their CI pipeline, along with vulnerability management for the security pro? What if you could either eliminate some existing security tools or reduce their use/cost?<br>3. What if you could scan containers and monitor their host and their traffic within K8s clusters? |




## Positioning Value 

### Elevator pitch 

> GitLab Ultimate is ideal for projects with executive visibility and strategic organizational usage. Ultimate enables IT transformation by optimizing and accelerating delivery while managing priorities, security, risk, and compliance. A single tool DevOps teams need to find and fix vulnerabilities in application code, its environments, and to manage their risk from detection through remediation.

*Note: Everything you get in Premium as well as free guest users, 50,000 CI/CD minutes, a named TAM, and more…*
