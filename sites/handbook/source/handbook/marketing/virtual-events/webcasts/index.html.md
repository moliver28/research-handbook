## BrightTALK Webcasts
{:#brighttalk .gitlab-purple}

### Quick Links
* [BrightTALK Support Portal](https://support.brighttalk.com/hc/en-us)
* [BrightTALK Academy](https://business.brighttalk.com/academy/)

### Types of BrightTALK Webcasts
{:#bt-types}

* **TALK (Live):** traditional live webcast with live speakers and Q&A.
   - Pre-event registration takes place
   - The event automatically converts to on-demand upon completion
* **RP (Replay)**: recorded webcast that appears to be hosted live
   - Pre-event registration takes place
   - At time of webcast, a recording is played. There is no live Q&A (technically), but it is best to do a mock Q&A and inform attendees that any questions will be individually addressed after the webinar, allowing for seamless follow up by SDRs.
   - The event automatically converts to on-demand upon completion
* **VD (Video)**: essentially an on-demand webcast acting as content syndication into the BrightTALK channel
   - No pre-registration

### BrightTALK Webcast Calendar
{:#bt-calendar}

The Campaigns Team manages the [BrightTALK webcast calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y19xdTVqMzRsZ2ZrcmlybmM5aGx1MWRkams0MEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which will be used to log all planned and scheduled BrightTALK webcasts and their related dry runs. **The purpose of the BrightTALK webcast calendar is to avoid scheduling overlapping webcasts and to provide visibility into all BrightTALK webcasts.**

**Adding to the calendar:**
1. Add tentative webcasts to the calendar with `[Hold]`
   * ex. `[Hold] TALK | 7 secrets of effective GitOps`
   * For dry run (practice) webcasts, add `DR` (ex. `[Hold DR] TALK | 7 secrets of effective gitops`)
   * Include a link to the issue in the event description
1. When the date/time/speakers of the webcast has been confirmed, remove `[Hold]` from the event title
   * ex. `TALK | 7 secrets of effective GitOps` or `RP | 7 secrets of effective GitOps`
   * Add the time of the webcast on the calendar event (if it is still an all-day event)
   * Add the epic link, and remove the issue link, in the calendar description
   * Add all presenters (internal GitLab team members and external speakers)
   * Add BrightTALK login information for presenters

## Project Management for BrightTALK Webcasts
{:#bt-project-management .gitlab-purple}

Campaign webcasts are hosted on BrightTALK, and project management is organized by Campaign Managers.

### BrightTALK Webcast Invitations
{:#bt-email-invitations}

:exclamation: **Note from @jgragnola: we are working on further templatizing these invitations so that copy changes are not needed and tokens take care of these emails.** ([issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/3422))

1. Update emails `Invitation 1 - 2 weeks prior`,  `Invitation 2 - 1 week prior` , and if needed `Invitation 3 - Day before` with relevant copies related to the webcast.
   * *Note: We normally use the same copy for all 3 emails and simply tweak the templated subject lines to sound more like “Reminders”.*
2. Approve copy and send samples to the requester, and the presenter (if different from requester).
3. Go to the `List` folder and edit the `Target List` smart list and input the names of past similar programs and applicable program statuses to the `Member of program` filter. This will make sure people that have attended programs with similar topics in the past are included in the invite.
   * Note: We may uplevel this logic to include webcast invitations within active nurture programs to limit the overhead for invitation emails.
4. Once you get approval on the sample email copy, schedule the email programs outlined in step 1.

### Add the webcast to the /events/ and /resources/ pages
{:#bt-webpage-listings}

*  To add the webcast to the /events page follow this [step by step guide](/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents).

### Switching BrightTALK Webcasts to On-Demand
