## Overview
{: #overview .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

External virtual events are, by definition, not owned and hosted by GitLab. They are hosted by an external third party (i.e. a partner or paid vendor). The goal of external virtual events is to drive net new leads, and we do not promote to our internal database. The various types of external virtual events are below, and involve epic and issue creation, designation of DRIs, and workback schedule definition within the issue due dates.

* [Channel Partner Webinars](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/external-virtual-events/#channel-partner-webinars): hosted by a channel partner (i.e. WWT), this is an unpaid tactic. The channel partner manages landing page, moderating and hosting the webinar on their platform. GitLab represents as a speaker at the event, sometimes jointly with an alliance partner. A lead list is often not shared after the event, as the channel partner will work the leads. We will sometimes promote, and determine which channels are appropriate.
* [Sponsored Webinars](): hosted on an external vendor platform (i.e. DevOps.com), this is a paid tactic. The vendor is responsible for driving registration, moderating and hosting the webinar on their platform, and delivering a lead list after the event. The goal of a sponsored webinar is net new leads - we do not promote to our existing database as it is a paid activity.
* [Virtual Conferences](): hosted on an external vendor platform (i.e. Hopin), this is a paid tactic. GitLab pays a sponsorship fee to receive a virtual booth and often speaking session or panel presence. The goal of a sponsored virtual conference is net new leads - we do not promote to our existing database as it is a paid activity.
* [Executive Roundtable](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/external-virtual-events/#-executive-roundtable):  hosted on an external vendor platform, this is a gathering of high level CxO attendees run as an open discussion between the moderator/host, GitLab expert and delegates. There usually aren't any presentations, but instead a discussion where anyone can chime in to speak. The host would prepare questions to lead discussion topics and go around the room asking delegates questions to answer. The goal of an executive roundtable is net new leads - we do not promote to our existing database as it is a paid activity.
* [Vendor Arranged Meetings](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/external-virtual-events/#-vendor-arranged-meetings): hosted by an external vendor, the vendor organizes one-to-one meetings with prospect or customer accounts. This does not include meetings set internally by GitLab team members. An example would be a "speed dating" style meeting setup where a vendor organizes meetings with prospects of interest to GitLab. The goal of a venor arranged meeting is to generate meetings with accounts of interest that we are finding challenging to break into directly - we do not promote to our existing database as it is a paid activity.

## Partner Webinar
{: #channel-partner-webinars .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*A sponsored webinar is hosted on an external vendor platform (e.g: DevOps.com), with the goal of driving net new leads. The vendor is responsible for driving registration, moderating and hosting the webinar on their platform, and delivering a lead list after the event. The project owner is responsible for creating the epic and related issue creation, and keeping timelines and DRIs up-to-date.*

### Process in GitLab to organize epic & issues
{: #channel-partner-webinar-project-management}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
The project owner is responsible for following the steps below to create the epic and related issues in GitLab.

1. Project owner creates the epic to house all related issues (code below)
1. Project owner creates the relevant issues required (shortcut links in epic code below)
1. Project owner associates all the relevant issues to the newly created epic, as well as the original issue
1. Project owner sets due dates for each issue, based on agreed upon SLAs between teams for each task, and confirms accurate ownership for each issue

*Note: if the date of the tactic changes, the project owner is responsible for changing the due dates of all related issues to match the new date, and alerting the team members involved.*
