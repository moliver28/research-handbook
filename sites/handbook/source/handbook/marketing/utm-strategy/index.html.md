## Overview

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
The purpose of this handbook page is to outline how our UTM strategy drives insightful dashboards in Sisense. You may learn how to use the UTM builder, and why it is critical that we use this consistent process across all marketing channels for consistent and useful reporting.

Everyone can contribute - See something you'd like to discuss or iterate on? Start an MR and post it in [#campaign-reporting](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CSBDEH2DQ) slack channel.

Below are some rules (per [PMG advice](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-advertising/-/issues/498#note_571907936)):
* Make all values lowercase, all the time - every time.
   - Why: Some platforms are case sensitive and others are not, and it's frankly just an easy thing to mess up when using builders, tools, etc. Some tools will automatically make something lowercase and then it messes something up because it's not the way you were expecting, or vice versa. Is an easy variable to eliminate.
* No spaces. So, if more than one word, using a hyphen.
   - Why: Spaces can be filled in with other characters when pulling from raw url and is just an easy/messy thing to avoid.
