## How are prescriptive buyer journeys used?

The prescriptive buyer journeys are the foundation for our top-funnel demand generation strategy, mapping the content offers most relevant to the persona based on stage in the funnel (awareness, consideration, decision/purchase). Tapping into our Marketo segmentations and building out targeting logic for our nurture engine will allow us to send the right offer to the right persona at the right time, based on their previous engagement and funnel stage.

*For example, if they are at an Inquiry state (Top Funnel) and have previously engaged with CI content, they would receive Consideration stage CI content to help them learn more about GitLab and progress to an MQL status, to be followed up with by SDRs.

The first iteration of building these prescriptive buyer journeys was a highly collaborative effort, mapping existing content. The process has helped to identify gaps and reasoning for persona storyboards to dig into the perspective of the buyer, and *then* build content to the needs of the buyer in the given stages.
