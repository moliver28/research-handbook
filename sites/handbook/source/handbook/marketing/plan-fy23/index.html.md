In FY23, we will introcude new **solution-focused campaigns** aimed at the executive level persona, while continuing our existing **capabilities-focused** campaign approach for the individual contributor level persona. 

We will continue our always-on and continually-optimized capabilities-focused campaigns with a deep focus on DevOps Platform. CI/CD, GitOps, and DevSecOps are capabilities-focused campaigns that will also be continued, in addition to our compete campaigns.

## Campaign Core Teams & Campaign Bundles
{: #campaign-core-teams .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
A campaign core team is comprised of teams across marketing and revenue programs, working togehter to build new campaigns and optimize ongoing campaigns. [Learn more here >>](/handbook/marketing/campaigns/#campaign-core-teams)

When a new campaign is being developed, the campaign core team will work together to develop a campaign bundle, which is then leveraged by all teams across marketing and sales for a cohesive approach from top funnel tactics to sales conversations. [Learn more here >>](/handbook/marketing/campaigns/#campaign-bundles)

## Value Plays
{: #value-plays .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
A value play's intended audience is sales (SALs, SAs, TAMs, SDR as applicable) to arm the sales teams as a part the outbound motion. In some cases, there will also be inbound marketing campaign component. The playbook prepares the sales person with both prescriptive actions to take as part of the outbound motion, as well as how to respond in the case of a supporting inbound marketing campaign.

*Note: this section to be updated in conversation with Allison Gleisner, or point instead to her updated handbook page(s).*

The Value Play should include (at minimum):  
- Context (promise/offer)
- Who to meet with
- What to say
- What to show/info to use
- How to measure progress

### Beyond the GTM Motion Core Teams
{: #beyond-core-teams}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
**All teams play an _INTEGRAL_ role in reaching our marketing goals, regardless if they are on the Core Team or not.** Differences in team alignment (i.e. to segment/region) and approaches that will span and leverage all GTM Motions, are two reasons for teams being beyond the Core Teams.

If your team or name is not listed as part of the core team, don't worry! As part of this FY22 Marketing Plan, a keen focus is alignment and ensuring everyone across marketing is connected and collaborating. **If you would like to participate on a Core Team, you may do so - connect with the Core Team of interest to learn more about getting involved!** Anyone joining a Core Team will be expected to be an active contributor and participant.

## Project Management

Each GTM campaign will each have an epic, where all teams can reference plans and the issues (i.e. action items) to accomplish the plans. We will be making use of 2 week milestones (Marketing - 2022-MM-DD). The Cammpaign Core Teams themselves will decide how often to have stand-ups, whether live or through slack, as well as any other synchronous calls.
