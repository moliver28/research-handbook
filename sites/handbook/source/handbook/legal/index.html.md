# GITLAB INC. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY

## PURPOSE
* This policy requires that each Related Party Transaction (as defined below) be considered for approval or ratification in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this policy (i) by the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”)of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of GitLab Inc. (the “Company”) or (ii) if the Audit Committee determines that the approval or ratification of such Related Party Transaction should be considered by all of the disinterested members of the Board, by such disinterested members of the Board by the vote of a majority thereof.
* A Related Party Transaction will be entered into or continued only if the Audit Committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set out in this policy having determined that the transaction is on terms that are not inconsistent with the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, or if the transaction is approved by the disinterested members of the Board.*This policy applies to all Related Party Transactions.
* The Audit Committee may review this policy from time to time and recommend amendments for consideration and approval by the Board.

## DEFINITIONS
* “Related Party Transaction”  means any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which:

1. the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 (USD) in any fiscal year   (including   any periodic payments or installments due on or after the beginning of the applicable   fiscal   year   and,   in   the case of indebtedness, the largest amount expected to be outstanding and the amount of annual interest thereon),
1. the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and
1. any Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect interest.

* “Related Party" means:

1. any person who is or at anytime since the beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year was a director or executive officer of the Company;
1. any shareholder who beneficially owns in excess of 5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock;
1. a person who is an immediate family member of any director or executive officer(which means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in law, and any person other than a tenant or employee sharing the house of such director or executive officer);and
1. any firm, corporation, charitable organization or other entity in which any of these persons is employed or an officer, general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which the person and all related parties has beneficial ownership interest of 10% or more.

## APPROVAL PROCESS
Prior to entering into the Related Party Transaction, the Related Party (or if the Related Party has an immediate family member who is a Related Party) must provide written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the facts and circumstances of the proposed Related Party Transaction. The written notice should include:

1. the Related Party’s relationship to the Company and the person’s interest in the transaction;
1. the   material   terms   of   the   proposed   transaction,   including   the   aggregate   value   or,   in   the   case   of in debtedness, the aggregate principal and interest rate;
1. the benefits to the Company of the proposed transaction;
1. if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; and
1. as assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party.

The  Corporate  Secretary  will  determine  whether  the  proposed  transaction is a Related  Party Transaction  for purposes of this policy and may meet with the relevant business unit or function leader to confirm and supplement the information in the notice. Any proposed transaction determined to be a Related Party Transaction will be submitted   to   the   disinterested   members   of   the   Audit   Committee   for   consideration   at   its next meeting. If the Corporate Secretary, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer, determines that it is not practical for the Company to wait until the next Audit Committee meeting, the Chair of the AuditCommittee has the authority to act between Committee meetings unless the Chair of the Audit Committee is aRelated Party in the Related Party Transaction.

The Audit Committee will consider all the relevant facts and circumstances, including the benefits to the Company, the potential effect on a director’s independence of entering into the transaction, the availability of other sources for the products or services, the terms of the transaction and the terms available to unrelated third parties generally.The Audit Committee may approve Related Party Transactions that it determines in good faith are not in consistent with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Chair of the Audit Committee will report to theAudit Committee at its next meeting with regard to any approval of a proposed transaction between Committee meetings under this policy. In the event multiple members of the Audit Committee, including the Chair of the AuditCommittee, are Related Parties, the Related Party Transaction will be considered by the disinterested members of the Board in place of the Audit Committee.

## RATIFICATION
If the Company or a Related Party becomes aware that any Related Party Transaction exists that has not been previously approved or ratified under this policy, it will promptly submit the transaction to the Audit Committee orChair of the Committee or disinterested members of the Board for consideration.

If the Company enters into a transaction that (i) the Company was not aware a Related Party Transaction at the time   it was entered into but which it subsequently determines is a Related Party Transaction   prior to full performance there of or (ii) did not constitute a Related Party Transaction at the time such transaction was entered into but thereafter becomes a Related Party Transaction prior to full performance thereof, then in either such case the Related Party Transaction shall be presented for consideration in the manner set forth above. TheAudit Committee or Chair of the Committee or Board will evaluate the transaction considering the criteria set out in the approval process under this policy and will consider all options, including ratification, amendment or termination of the Related Party Transaction.

## REVIEW OF ONGOING TRANSACTIONS
At the Audit Committee’s first meeting of each fiscal year, the committee will evaluate any continuing Related Party Transactions that have remaining amounts receivable of more than $120,000 to determine if it is in the best   interests of the Company and its shareholders to continue, modify or terminate the Related Party Transaction.

## DISCLOSURE
All Related Party Transactions will be disclosed to the Audit Committee and any material Related Party Transaction will be disclosed to the Board



# General Legal FAQs

## 1. The U.S. Attorney-Client Relationship 
This discussion is limited to the practice of law in the U.S. As we continue to grow globally we will update this and expand how privilege applies in other jurisdictions.

### What is Attorney-Client Privilege?
Attorney-Client Privilege is a principle that provides protections for certain communications between clients and their attorneys that meet specific criteria. 

First of all, the communications must be for the purpose of seeking legal guidance and advice. For this reason, the underlying facts may not be protected if they are available from another source. Opinions and analysis of the facts, and discussions thereof, with the attorney are protected. 

Secondly, communications must be confidential. Information is also not protected if it is available from another source meaning that simply telling your attorney or copying your attorney on a communication does not protect the information. 

### What is Work Product Privilege?
Work Product is a U.S. doctrine in which an attorney’s notes, observations, thoughts, and research prepared by, or at the direction of, an attorney in anticipation of litigation are protected from being discoverable during the litigation process.

### What is the purpose of these Privileges?
Attorney-Client and Work Product privileges allow clients to speak freely with their attorneys and encourage full disclosure so they can receive accurate and competent legal advice without the fear of having their attorney compelled to testify against them and disclose the information shared by the client.

### Who do these Privileges Apply to at GitLab?
There is not one uniform answer that covers all jurisdictions in the U.S. However, most jurisdictions will use at least one of the following tests to see if the individuals involved have privileged communication.

- The **Control Group Test**. This test is quite restrictive and only allows for the protection of corporate communications to the corporation's controlling executives and managers. This test cannot be used in federal courts, but is still used in some states.
- The **Subject Matter Test**. Instead of looking solely at the roles of the employees involved, this test looks at the subject matter of the employees’ communications. If an employee has been directed by a supervisor to discuss a subject matter that relates to the employees job with an attorney, this may be covered by subject matter privilege.
- The **Upjohn Test**. This modified version of the Subject Matter Test requires additional criteria to be met. In addition to the subject matter being relevant to the employee’s duties, the employee must also have awareness and intent concerning the legal advice being sought and/or given.
- The **Upjohn Warning**. A company’s attorney does not represent an employee individually, but instead represents the interests of the company. A company can waive its privilege at any time, meaning the company could choose to disclose information the attorney received from a covered employee in confidence for use as evidence in a legal proceeding in order to protect the company from liability.
 
### How do you Protect the Privileges that Apply to You When Seeking Legal Advice?
- Direct the communication to a practicing licensed attorney. Privilege does not apply to other non-attorney members of the legal team.
- It is best practice to have privileged conversations with the attorney via Zoom.
- If other individuals will need to participate in the discussion, consult with the attorney, and only include the minimum necessary individuals in the conversation, in other words, keep the circle of trust small.
- If it is necessary to communicate by email, in the “Subject” line, and at the top of the body of the communication, include the phrase “AC PRIV”.
- Do not overuse the claim of privilege. Limit its use to when actually seeking legal guidance and advice and not on any and every correspondence with the attorney.
- You must keep the information discussed confidential, and not share it with anyone outside the circle of trust without first consulting with the attorney.
- Do not forward protected emails to anyone outside the circle of trust.
- Do not copy anyone outside the circle of trust on emails with the attorney.

For more questions and answers about Attorney-Client Privilege in the corporate setting, search “AC Priv tests” in Drive.

## 2. Litigation Holds

### What is a Litigation Hold?

A litigation hold is the process a company uses to preserve all forms of relevant evidence, whether it be emails, instant messages, physical documents, handwritten or typed notes, voicemails, raw data, backup tapes, and any other type of information that could be relevant to pending or imminent litigation or when litigation is reasonably anticipated.  Litigation holds are imperative in preventing spoliation (destruction, deletion, or alteration) of evidence which can have a severely negative impact on the company's case, including leading to sanctions.

Once the company becomes aware of potential litigation, the company's attorney will provide notice to the impacted employees, instructing them not to delete or destroy any information relating to the subject matter of the litigation.  The litigation hold applies to paper and electronic documents. During a litigation hold, all retention policies must be overridden.

## 3. Human Rights

### How is GitLab advancing Human Rights?

We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings around the world should be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. Our company will only engage suppliers and direct contractors who demonstrate a serious commitment to the health and safety of their workers, and operate in compliance with human rights laws. GitLab does not use or condone the use of slave labor or human trafficking, denounces any degrading treatment of individuals or unsafe working condition, and supports our products being free of conflict minerals.

#### Anti-Slavery and Anti-Human Trafficking Policy

1. Slavery and Human Trafficking are crimes and violations of fundamental human rights. These violations take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, and/or human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. GitLab is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in our business dealings and relationships by implementing and enforcing systems/controls to ensure modern slavery or human trafficking are not taking place in our business, or with those with whom we do business.

2. GitLab is also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our business and in our approach to tackling slavery and human trafficking throughout our supply chains and overall organization, consistent with disclosure obligations we may have under applicable law. To that end, we prohibit the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children by anyone working for or with GitLab.

3. All employees, directors, officers, agents, interns, vendors, distributors, resellers, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners are expected to comply with this policy.

4. Every Team Member is responsible to assist in the prevention, detection and reporting of slavery and human trafficking by those working for or with GitLab.  Each Team Member is encouraged to raise concerns about any known or suspected incidents of slavery or human trafficking in any parts of our business or supply chains at the earliest possible stage.   If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions within any tier of our supply chains or business partners constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery/human trafficking, raise it at Compliance@Gitlab.com.

5. We may terminate our relationship with individuals and/or Business Partners if they breach this policy.
