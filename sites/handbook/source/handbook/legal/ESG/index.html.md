## Overview
The ESG Team creates and maintains GitLab’s Corporate Sustainability strategy and programs. This includes ESG disclosures and public ESG reporting, identifying and prioritizing key issues to advance GitLab’s social and environmental goals, and creating partnerships with non-profit organizations that support GitLab’s values and mission.

## ESG Strategy
The [ESG Team](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/legal-and-corporate-affairs/environmental-social-governance/)  is in the process of conducting a formal materiality assessment to speak with GitLab’s internal and external stakeholders to identify and prioritize its key environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Stakeholders will provide insights and viewpoints on key issues for the company from both a financial materiality and impact materiality perspective. 

The results of the assessment will drive GitLab’s Corporate Sustainability strategy, key issues, and program development. 

Check back in early 2023 for updates.
