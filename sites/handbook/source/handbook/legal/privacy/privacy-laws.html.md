GitLab treats every users' data the same regardless of their local regulations because we take privacy seriously. Still, there are some privacy laws that get a lot of attention, so we want our team members to understand what they are about. Below are some explanations of laws you may have already heard of.

## GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulations came into effect in the European Union in May 2018.  Anyone who handles personal information of Europeans must comply.  In the European Union, privacy of personal information is a right – like human dignity, freedom, equality and the opposite of left.  It is a personal right belonging to the owner of the information and cannot be commoditized, utilized, processed without that person’s consent.  The European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) diligently try to preserve the rights of their citizens but such efforts were without coordinated and express direction – until now.  The GDPR reflects a unified approach to handling personal, sensitive information in the EU/EEA.

The regulation is implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It applies to all companies selling and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
