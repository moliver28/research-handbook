## Principle of Compliance

Everything we do matters. At GitLab, we comply with the policies and procedures because it is the right thing to do and because we value integrity. Some people attempt to find so many loopholes in the rules that they actually alter the underlying principle of the matter. But at GitLab, principles matter, and we are serious about compliance.  

## Confidential Information

There are three primary categories of company secrets discussed here: 
* Trade Secrets
* Confidential Information 

Collectively, these things are classified as [RED in our Data Classification Policy](/handbook/engineering/security/data-classification-standard.html#red).  The “Red” designation is for the most sensitive, restricted business information that requires heightened internal controls by limiting access to only those authorized individuals with a need-to-know. 

**Trade Secrets** are those extra bits of information that set our company apart.  It’s that stuff that is so cutting edge that we don’t even want to get a patent on it for fear of letting others know the technology.  If you patent something, the secret ingredients are laid out for the world to see like some crazy technological recipe. Competitors quickly mobilize for comparable product offerings.  But where there is a trade secret, competitors are left in the dark. However, once you release a trade secret – there is no protection.  It is all out there for the world to exploit; this is why we have employees sign non-disclosures. 

Another set of secrets include **Confidential Information**.  This is more than the general confidential stuff.  This includes the provocative business data that helps us run strategically and includes business development plans/strategies, non-public financial information, third party data and government protected information.  (Trade Secrets technically fall under this category but given its unique stature, it gets celebrity status.)  Failing to protect heightened confidential information could cause all sorts of bad feelings with GDPR, EUCI, SOX, EUEC, DOJ, DOC, SEC, OAIC and others.  In other words, if you fail to execute proper controls and restraint, you will be attacked by nothing short of alphabet soup with a badge. 
 

## Cookies and Consent
 
Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) sit alongside the Data Protection Act and the GDPR. They give people specific privacy rights in relation to electronic communications.  PECR sets specific rules around marketing, secure communication services and customer privacy (as regards traffic and location data, itemised billing, line identification, directory listings) and - you guessed it - cookies (which is broadly defined).
 
There are important factors to consider with cookies in general. 
If you use cookies you must:
* say what cookies will be sent;
* explain what the cookies will do; and
* obtain consent to store cookies on devices.
 
PECR expands the definition of cookies to include “similar technologies” like fingerprinting techniques. Therefore, unless an exemption applies, any use of device fingerprinting requires the provision of clear and comprehensive information as well as the consent of the user or subscriber.
 
Consent is not required if the cookie is used: “(a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network; or  (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user.”
 
Please note that cookies for analytics purposes are not “strictly necessary.” 
 
PECR applies to any technology that stores or accesses information on the user’s device. This could include, for example, HTML5 local storage, Local Shared Objects and fingerprinting techniques.
 
Device fingerprinting is a technique that involves combining a set of information elements in order to uniquely identify a particular device. Examples of the information elements that device fingerprinting can single out, link, or infer include (but are not limited to):
* data derived from the configuration of a device;
* data exposed by the use of particular network protocols;
* CSS information;
* JavaScript objects;
* HTTP header information,
* clock information;
* TCP stack variation;
* installed fonts;
* installed plugins within the browser; and
* use of any APIs (internal and/or external).
 
It is also possible to combine these elements with other information, such as IP addresses or unique identifiers, etc.
 
PECR also applies to technologies like scripts, tracking pixels and plugins, wherever these are used.
 
If you provide cookies that fall in these categories, consent is required.  You never know who is on a technological diet.  Ask before you give them a cookie.  

## Export

Governments throughout the world pose restrictions on their technology.  Various countries state that if the technology is of their origin, it falls under the laws of their country.  

GitLab US technology is subject to US law.  US law states their technology cannot be exported to Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba, North Korea or the Crimean Region of the Ukraine. US law also has a list of entities to whom they prohibit passing the technology.  

A prohibition is a prohibition.  There are no loopholes.  If a country or a person is restricted, they are not allowed to see the guts of the technology through other mechanisms.  There simply aren’t loopholes in export law.  The only way you can get around the restrictions is to get permission from the government directly.  This permission is provided in the form of a license. 

Violating export laws can result in civil and criminal penalties for the officers of the company and the individuals involved.
