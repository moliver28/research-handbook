## Principle of Compliance

Everything we do matters. At GitLab, we comply with the policies and procedures because it is the right thing to do and because we value integrity. Some people attempt to find so many loopholes in the rules that they actually alter the underlying principle of the matter. But at GitLab, principles matter, and we are serious about compliance.  

## Export

Governments throughout the world pose restrictions on their technology.  Various countries state that if the technology is of their origin, it falls under the laws of their country.  

GitLab US technology is subject to US law.  US law states their technology cannot be exported to Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba, North Korea or the Crimean Region of the Ukraine. US law also has a list of entities to whom they prohibit passing the technology.  

A prohibition is a prohibition.  There are no loopholes.  If a country or a person is restricted, they are not allowed to see the guts of the technology through other mechanisms.  There simply arenâ€™t loopholes in export law.  The only way you can get around the restrictions is to get permission from the government directly.  This permission is provided in the form of a license. 

Violating export laws can result in civil and criminal penalties for the officers of the company and the individuals involved.
