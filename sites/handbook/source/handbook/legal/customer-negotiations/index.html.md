## OPERATIONAL

## How to reach Legal 
1. For all questions related to Partners and/or Customers: NDA's, Contract Review / Negotiations, Legal Questions...etc., please open a **Legal Request** in SFDC 
2. Please note: There is a $25K opportunity minimum threshold to review edits to our terms, and a $100K opportunity minimum threshold to review Customer / Partner Terms. These thresholds do not apply to NDA's. 
3. A presentation on this topic can be found here (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lesWNvPAFd1B3RuCgKsqQlE85ZEwLuE01QpVAKPhQKw/edit#slide=id.g5d6196cc9d_2_0) 

## How do I get an Agreement signed
1. Only certain individuals may execute on behalf of GitLab see Authorization Matrix here: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix
2. All Agreements require a GitLab Legal stamp in order to be executed. This stamp is placed by a Contract Manager when an executable version is reached. 
3. Electronic signature requests can be generated from Sertifi in SFDC, OR, HelloSign.  


## EDUCATIONAL

## Overview of GitLab Agreements
1. Make sure that the final, negotiated contract is in the contract record. (If any negotiations have happened outside of SalesForce/Conga, upload the final, agreed-upon version to the contract record as a new version of the contract.)
2. Change the Contract Status to “Approved to Sign”.
3. Send a chatter message to the Sales account owner to stage for signing.
4. Once signed, the sales account owner will be responsible for uploading the final document, filling out all of the remaining fields in the contract record, and changing the Contract Status to "Active"
