1. For all questions related to Partners and/or Customers, including: NDA's, Contract Review / Negotiations, Legal Questions...etc., please open a **Legal Request** in SFDC. 
2. Please note: There is a $25K opportunity minimum threshold to review edits to our terms, and a $100K opportunity minimum threshold to review Customer / Partner Terms. These thresholds do not apply to NDA's. 
3. Step-by-Step directions on opening a Legal Request can be found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#request-editable-version-of-gitlab-template)
4. A presentation on this topic can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lesWNvPAFd1B3RuCgKsqQlE85ZEwLuE01QpVAKPhQKw/edit#slide=id.g5d6196cc9d_2_0)

1. **Sales Reps cannot sign any Agreements.** Only certain individuals may execute on behalf of GitLab see Authorization Matrix [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix). 
2. All Agreements require a GitLab Legal stamp in order to be executed. This stamp is placed by a Contract Manager when an executable version is reached. 
3. Electronic signature requests can be generated from Sertifi in SFDC, OR, HelloSign.

## Overview of GitLab Agreements

</figure>

1. GitLab provides our Software pursuant to the GitLab Subscription Agreement, and Professional Services pursuant to GitLab Professional Services Terms;
2. GitLab has a Master Partner Agreement that includes multiple Exhibits to enable Partners to, (i) Reseller, (ii) Refer, and (iii) Distribute GitLab Products and Services;
3. Other than web-portal purchases, GitLab enters into an Order Form with a Customer which outlines the Products and Services being sold;
4. Any modification(s) to Order Forms, or standard Terms and Conditions, require GitLab Legal Approval. 

## When does GitLab negotiate
<figure class="video_container">

1. GitLab will negotiate NDAs with our prospects. You can always send the prospect the GitLab NDA template found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/practical-handbook-edits//handbook/legal/#contract-templates) and ask for them to sign. If they want to use their template, simply open a Legal Request for "Contract Review".
2. GitLab will negotiate changes to our terms and conditions provided the [current] Opportunity is greater than $25K (USD).
3. GitLab will negotiate using a Customer terms and conditions-if they are applicable to our Software and business-if the [current] Opportunity is greater than $100K (USD).
4. **Why don't we negotiate with all Customers?** Using resources to negotiate on all deals would not be a good use of GitLab resources and instead, we created our terms to be reasonable and in line with industry standards which allows us to place our resources into creating better products and services.
