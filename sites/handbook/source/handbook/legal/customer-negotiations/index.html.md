## Finalize the Contract Record and Notify the Salesperson 
1. Make sure that the final, negotiated contract is in the contract record. (If any negotiations have happened outside of SalesForce/Conga, upload the final, agreed-upon version to the contract record as a new version of the contract.)
2. Change the Contract Status to “Approved to Sign”.
3. Send a chatter message to the Sales account owner to stage for signing.
4. Once signed, the sales account owner will be responsible for uploading the final document, filling out all of the remaining fields in the contract record, and changing the Contract Status to "Active"
