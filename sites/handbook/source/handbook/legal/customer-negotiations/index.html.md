## Completing Vendor Request Forms

**It is the sales team member responsibility to complete Vendor Request Forms**
1. Much, if not all, of the Vendor Form information can be found at the [Company Information Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/company-information)

**Included on the Company Information Page is:**
- Address / information related to each GitLab entity
- All banking information
- ECCN Number
- NAICS Code
- Dun and Bradstreet Number
...AND VARIOUS OTHER DETAILS
- W9 is located on the Finance [Forms page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/#forms)
- Request Insurance Certificate on [Legal Team Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/#4-requests-for-insurance-certificate)

2.  If there are questions / elements that are not found in the Company Information Page, the Sales Rep should engage Deal Desk to organize requests of finance and tax. Information regarding contacting Deal Desk and overall process can be found at the [Sales Order Process Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-process-customer-requested-vendor-setup-forms)

3. **ONLY OPEN A LEGAL REQUEST IF:** There is a specific legal question / element being requested within the Vendor Form.

Example: Has GitLab, or board member / executed of GitLab, been subject to a lawsuit? 

 
**As a private company, we will not share the following information in a Vendor Request Form:** 
- Stock / Share ownership of the company
- Finances, including annual and/or historical performance 

## What's needed to close a Deal
### 🎥 [Watch the "What's needed to close a Deal" Video](www.UPDATE.COM)

1. Visit the [Sales Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/) and [Deal Desk](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/) Handbook materials to review how to create an Order Form. 
2. An Order Form with a base Agreement referenced. This will either be the current [Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/) as found at the [Terms of Service](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/#current-terms-of-use), or, if an executed Agreement is signed, this will be referenced within the Order Form. 
3. Visit the presentation on the [Legal Requirements](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IaGO8j--WOKZqAwuBQjKJJN0hU7rfpdgbIoj_kClGK0/edit#slide=id.g5d6196cc9d_2_219) _Note: This is locked for GitLab Team Members only_
4. The fastest way to close a deal is to ensure the Customer signs the Order Form. If a Customer refuses to sign an Order Form, additional approvals will be required by both GitLab Legal and Finance team members. In addition, the Customer may need to make changes to their Purchase Order (PO). 


## Requests for GitLab Financial Information, Tax and Insurance Certificates

1. For Tax Certificate requests please email the Finance team at [tax@gitlab.com](mailto:tax@gitlab.com)
2. For Insurance Certificate requests please work with the Deal Desk team by tagging @sales-support in SFDC Chatter.  
3. Regarding GitLab financial information (e.g., annual statements, equity ownership...etc) please note that GitLab is a private company and does not share this information with Customers.

## Overview of GitLab Agreements
### 🎥 [Watch the "Overview of GitLab Agreements" Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3ktHGDBebw)
*Learn about what Agreements GitLab has; 2:45 (Log into GitLab Unfiltered)*

1. GitLab provides our Software pursuant to the GitLab Subscription Agreement, and Professional Services pursuant to GitLab Professional Services Terms;
2. GitLab has a Master Partner Agreement that includes multiple Exhibits to enable Partners to, (i) Reseller, (ii) Refer, and (iii) Distribute GitLab Products and Services;
3. Other than web-portal purchases, GitLab enters into an Order Form with a Customer which outlines the Products and Services being sold;
4. Any modification(s) to Order Forms, or standard Terms and Conditions, require GitLab Legal Approval. 

## When does GitLab negotiate
### 🎥 [Watch the "When does GitLab Negotiate Video"](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYvZKP5OohA)
*Learn about when GitLab negotiates; Where to find an NDA template; 3:20 (Log into GitLab Unfiltered)*

1. GitLab will negotiate NDAs with our prospects. You can always send the prospect the GitLab NDA template and ask for them to sign. If they want to use their template, simply open a Legal Request for "Contract Review".
2. GitLab will negotiate changes to our terms and conditions provided the [current] Opportunity is greater than $25K (USD).
3. GitLab will negotiate using a Customer terms and conditions-if they are applicable to our Software and business-if the [current] Opportunity is greater than $100K (USD).
4. **Why don't we negotiate with all Customers?** Using resources to negotiate on all deals would not be a good use of GitLab resources and instead, we created our terms to be reasonable and in line with industry standards which allows us to place our resources into creating better products and services.

## Data Privacy and the GitLab Data Processing Addendum

1. The [GitLab Privacy Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/) explains how GitLab collects, uses and shares customer's personal information, and how they may exercise their rights in respect of that information. More information about privacy compliance at GitLab, including answers to a number of frequently asked questions concerning the GDPR, can be found on the [GitLab Privacy Compliance](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/privacy-compliance/) handbook page.
1. The GitLab Data Processing Addendum, usually referred to as the "DPA", can be accessed from the [GitLab Terms of Service page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/raw/master/BR_signed_Hosted_DPA_V1-brobins_gitlab.com.pdf). As stated in the [GitLab Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/#14-security--data-protection), the terms of the DPA automatically apply to corporate customers.
1. Some customers, particularly those based in Europe or otherwise subject to the GDPR, will require a signed copy of the DPA. To provide a customer with a signed DPA, follow the [Processing Signed DPAs workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/data_processing_addendums.html#workflow).    


## Why GitLab does not sign BAAs

1. **GitLab will not sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**

2. Resources to provide your Customer if they request a BAA:

**What do the GitLab Terms say?**
- GitLab is transparent with respect to information it requires, or does not require, in order to provide our products and services. Please view [Section 14.3 of the Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/#14-security--data-protection), which specifically highlights that GitLab will not receive Personal Heatlh Information. 

**Why does GitLab not sign BAAs?**
- GitLab, as a commercial software product, does not require nor is designed to be used to store Personal Health Information (PHI). In addition, GitLab, as an organiztion, does not desire or need to receive, process, store, transact or otherwise possess PHI in order to provide our products and servcies. As such, GitLab does not meet, or desire to meet, the definition of a "Business Associate" as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  
- In the event a Customer questions "incidental dislcosures", please highlight the HIPAA definition itself, which states: _“Business associate functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity include claims processing, data analysis, utilization review, and billing.  Business associate services to a covered entity are limited to legal, actuarial, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services. **However, persons or organizations are not considered business associates if their functions or services do not involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, and where any access to protected health information by such persons would be incidental, if at all.**”_
