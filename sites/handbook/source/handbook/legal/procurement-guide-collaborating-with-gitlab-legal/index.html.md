For general questions that **_do not_** require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information, you can reach out to the GitLab Legal Team at *[`#legal`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/legal)*.

| Type of Request | Process / Information |
| ------ | ------ |
| NDA Request / Signature | [NDA Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/procurement-guide-collaborating-with-gitlab-legal/#nda-process)|

## NDA Process
- Prior to exchanging any confidential information, GitLab and a potential Vendor should execute a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement. This will ensure the adequate protection of any / all information shared. 
- Update the standard [Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hRAMBYrYcd9yG8FOItsfN0XYgdp32ajt/view) with the Vendor information. 
- Send the updated Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement to the potential Vendor for signature. This should be done via HelloSign or other Electronic Signature method. 
- **DO NOT SIGN THE NDA YOURSELF** Only authorized individuals can executed contracts on behalf of GitLab. Please view the [Signatory Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix) for who may counter-sign the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement. 
- NOTE: If a potential vendor requires the use of their NDA template, please follow the process located on the [Procurement Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/) which will initiate the legal review process. 

## Negotiating Terms
- For any purchases made by GitLab, there must be applicable terms and conditions. 
- GitLab prefers to use the [Standard Terms and Conditions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-guidelines/#standard-vendor-terms-and-conditions), which includes terms related to purchasing both software and/or professional services.
- All vendors must agree to comply and act in accordance with the [GitLab Code of Business Conduct and Ethics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/gitlab-code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics/)
- For information regarding purchase requests and negotiation thresholds, please visit the [Procurement Toolkit](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/purchase-request-process/).
