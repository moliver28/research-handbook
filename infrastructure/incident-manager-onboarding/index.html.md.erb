## Introduction
This page is meant to be the starting point for onboarding as an Incident Managers.

As a means to ensure a healthly [Incident Manager](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#incident-manager-responsibilities) rotation with sufficient staffing and no significant burden on any single individual we staff this role with Team Members from across Engineering. As an Incident Manager, Team Members learn how we run GitLab.com and other GitLab SaaS environments. They help ensure the availability goals for GitLab.com by working with reliability engineers on call and development team members. The experience and awareness gained in this role leads to better understanding of building GitLab at scale and ultimately, a more reliable and scalable GitLab SaaS service and product.

### Questions about becoming an Incident Manager

#### Who are the Incident Managers?

Incident Manager responsibilities are expected of Engineering Management and Staff+ Engineer job families in the Development and Infrastructure Departments. Previously, Incident Manager responsibilities were fulfilled by a small group of managers in the Infrastructure department.  All team members in eligible roles are expected to participate in the Incident Manager rotation.

#### How many Team Members are needed to appropriately staff the Incident Manager pool? 
A minimum of 24 Team Members are needed in order to provide global coverage and ensure that any single individuals are not overly burdened. In addition to the overall total of 24, a minimum of 6 within each major timezone geography are also required. With sufficient staffing, the Incident Manager duties can be performed during a shift which is proximate to a normal business hours working day time for each individual.

#### Is this a volunteer effort? 

No.  All team members in eligible roles are expected to participate in the Incident Manager rotation.  We are looking to maximize the number of participants since a larger pool lowers the burden on each individual.  We will consider exceptions on a case by case basis.  Please talk to your manager if you do not think you can participate or would need an alternative schedule.  Assignment and exceptions to participation will be coordinated by the VP of Infrastructure and the VP of Development or their designees. Eligible development roles are the current and incoming directors, engineering managers, and staff engineers.

#### What are the expected commitments? and how do I balance my normal job responsibilities?
Starting October 4, 2021 the shifts are 4 hours each starting at 23:00 & 03:00 UTC (APAC), 07:00 UTC & 11:00 UTC (EMEA), and 15:00 & 19:00 UTC (AMER) each day. Each Incident Manager On Call assignment is for 3 consecutive days where a Team Member in the Incident Manager On Call role will have that responsibility for the shift which corresponds to their geography. Shifts will include weekends based on this 3 day rotating assignment.
When you are scheduled to be Incident Manager On Call, this must by your #1 work priority. However, while it is the priority, there may not be any incidents. When there is not an active incident requiring Incident Manager leadership you maintain your normal work duties. 
Currently, pages to Incident Manager On Calls happen roughly 0 to 4 times a week. During the time an Incident Manager is oncall, there is a 15 minute SLA to respond to escalations. This can mean dropping out of meetings, 1:1s, etc. to join incident calls. This demand can make balancing hard, and you may have to reschedule meetings on short notice. Because of the interrupt-driven nature of incident management, it is advised that you shift sync meetings which would be difficult for you to leave to a later date.

#### How often will I have an Incident Manager shift?
Three day shifts mean that, at the most, a Team Member participating in Incident Manager will have shifts every 19 days (assuming minimum 6 person pool). Each additional Team Members added to the pool in your region extends this timing by 3 days. The more Team Members involved, the less often any individual will have shifts. 

#### Can I shift my Incident Manager On Call days around?
Yes, this is one of the other benefits of having a well staffed pool of Team Members engaged as Incident Managers. Shift "trades" are easy to arrange in Pagerduty. It is your responsibility to ensure that your assigned shift is covered, but in extraordinary circumstances please reach out to the VP of Infrastructure for assistance.

#### How does someone onboard into the Incident Manager rotation? 
Create an Incident Manager onboarding issue via [this link](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/new?issuable_template=imoc_onboarding).


#### Will the Incident Managers always be the same people?
No. It is intended that we rotate Team Members in/out of the Incident Manager pool approximately every 6 months. These rotations will begin in Jan 2022 with a couple Team Members every few weeks so that we establish a rotation that is spread out instead of everyone rotating at the same time.
