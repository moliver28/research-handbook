## Introduction
This page is meant to be the starting point for someone looking to learn about IMOC and eventually join the rotation.

At first, just the managers of Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) at GitLab were involved in incident management at GitLab by acting as an Incident Manager On-Call (IMOC).  We are looking to expand the rotation and number of people who can do the[IMOC role](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#incident-manager-on-call-imoc-responsibilities) at GitLab for GitLab SaaS environments. As an incident manager, people get to learn about how we run GitLab.com and other GitLab SaaS environments.  They get to help ensure the availability goals for GitLab.com by working with other reliablity engineers on call and development team members. 

### Questions about getting into IMOC

#### What prerequisites are there?
This is largely thanks to [PagerDuty's guide](https://response.pagerduty.com/training/incident_commander/):
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills
* High level knoweledge of GitLab architecture and how [GitLab.com is architected](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/)
* Ability to size up a situation, assess the effectiveness of various tactics/strategies, and make rapid decisions on appropriate courses of action.
* Has flexibility, and is able to listen to expert feedback, modifying plans on-the-fly as necessary and knows when to ask for more help.
* Has gravitas, takes command, and is willing to ask people to leave a call to remove distractions, even if it's the CEO.

#### Who can join?
Senior or above members of Support, Development and Infrastructure teams.

#### How does someone onboard into the IMOC rotation? 
Create an IMOC onboarding issue from [the template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/new?issuable_template=imoc_onboarding)

#### What are the expected commitments? and how do I balance my normal job responsibilities?
The commitment will vary with the size of the IMOC rotation.  Currently shifts are 12 hours from 04:00 - 16:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC - 04:00 UTC during weekdays.  There is a separate weekend rotation staffed by Infrastructure managers.  As we grow the rotations, we may be able to change the shifts to a 3 by 8 hour rotation.  The frequency of oncall depends on how many people are in the rotation.  It could be as short as every other week or once every 4 weeks.  Ask in #infrastructure-lounge if you are curios what the current rotation is like.  Currently, pages to IMOCS happen roughly one to four times a week.  During the time an IMOC is oncall, there is a 15 minute SLA to respond to escalations, though we usually are faster for high severity events.  This can mean dropping out of meetings, 1:1s, etc to join incident calls.  This demand can make balancing hard.  You may have to reschedule meetings on short notice.

#### Can I withdraw?  
Yes - we do value the right to a 2 way door decision.

## Learning about Incident Management 
We have a dedicated [IMOC onboarding template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/imoc_onboarding.md) for getting a person involved in the Incident Manager role.

## Joining the rotation and vision
As we add more people to the IMOC rotation, your time will likely be much less frequent for oncall. Assuming we can get to 18 people with 6 in each "region", IMOCs will only be oncall once every 6 weeks for the 24x5 weekdays that are critical to cover.
