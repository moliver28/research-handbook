## About me

I am from Cape Town in South Africa. I have a B.Sc. degree in computer science from the [University of Cape Town](https://www.cs.uct.ac.za/). I've worked as
a software engineer in the healthcare, finance, telecoms, and tech sectors.

I've started several companies, but the only one you may have heard of is called [Gitter](https://gitter.im/), which was acquired by GitLab in 2017. This is how I joined the company.

I've done a lot of traveling including a 20,000km trip around Southern Africa in a beat up old Toyota Hilux and a 1 year+ round-the-world
trip.

I lived in London in the UK for 17 years, but moved back to Cape Town in 2019. London and Cape Town are my two favourite cities, for very different reasons.

I love working remotely, especially because it means I get to spend more time with my kids.

## Responsibilities

The **Distinguished Engineer, Infrastructure** is a member of the Infrastructure team and works with both management and individual contributors to achieve the department's objectives.

### Specific areas of focus and interest within the Infrastucture department

* **Team alignment**: primarily, I am focused on working with the Scalability and Observability teams, with additiona focus on
  Datastores Team (an Gitaly in particular) and Delivery.
* **Resource Utilisation and Saturation**: the cloud infrastructure that we run GitLab.com is, for our purposes,
  almost infinitely expandable, for our ability to scale up is limited by the bottlenecks and saturation points
  in our application and associated infrastructure. As DE, Infrastructure, it is my responsibility to understand,
  model, monitor and communicate these critical components.
* **Capacity Planning**: related to resource utilisation and saturation, capacity planning is about understanding
  when we will hit these critical bottlenecks, and planning ahead to avoid them.
* **Service Level Monitoring**: service-level monitoring is about measuring quality of service from the point-of-view of the consumers of a service.
  At GitLab we monitor four key metrics for each service, Apdex (a measure of latency), Requests-per-Second, Error Rates and Saturation & Utilization. Together
  we sometimes refer to these metrics as ARES (from the first letters of the measurements). We also define service-level objectives, or SLOs, for each service
  and monitor the services against these objectives.
* **Attribution & Ownership**: GitLab's monolithic architecture provides us with many advantages, but being able to attribute a change that leads to a particular
  regression or bug is more challenging with this model. While some components, such as Gitaly and Pages, are easy to attribute to a responsible team, most
  changes are not. Attribution & ownership is about assigning responsibility of areas of the codebase to particular teams (usually via `feature_categories`).
  This is a two-way process: it's about encouraging development teams to be involved in the execution of their code in production and infrastructure teams
  communicating back to the development teams.
* **Observability**: metrics, logs and traces. Having good observability allows engineers to better understand the
  internal state of the application. In turn, better understanding helps improve availability, resilience, and reduce mean-time-to-
* **GitLab.com Incidents**: I will frequently join incident calls. Primarily, I'm there to observe, so that we can iteratively improve our
  systems to avoid similar incidents in future.

### Mentoring

> Of all the attributes that go to make up a distinguished engineer, being the engineer that inspires and helps others is, to my mind, the single most important. A distinguished engineer is someone a team can build around for any project, a person who will spend time developing others and making them far better at their job then they were before.

Engineering ICs are welcome to reach out to discuss career development, mentoring, either on a formal or informal basis.

### Customer Needs

> A distinguished engineer will bring a relentless focus on delivering value for customers. They understand the customer need, and when itâ€™s a new market they spend a lot of time trying to understand what the potential needs will be. They adjust course when necessary, and bring their team long with them.

I'm happy to engage with technical teams at prospects and clients. Account Managers are welcome to book time in my calendar for this.

## North Star Principals

Inspiration taken from https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/

**A heavy bias towards action**

> Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

**Iteration**

Related to the previous point, frequent, small, low-risk reversible incremental changes are almost always preferable to big risky changes.
Compounding small incremental changes leads to big outcomes while keeping risk low. Big changes are nearly always a smell and I will encourage

**Feedback**

I am always willing to accept feedback, and will try my best to address it. Please DM me on Slack, or better yet, setup a call.

## Talks

Occassionally I will talk at conferences. Here are some of the talks I have given:

* Devopsdays Cape Town 2019 https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-cape-town/program/andrew-newdigate/
* Monitorama PDX 2019 https://vimeo.com/341141334
* PromCon EU 2019 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swnj6KTRg08
* Google Cloud Next 2019 - Lhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve_9mbJHPXQ
* ScaleConf 2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zL9DymXi1E

## Engage with Andrew

1. Start with an issue in the [Infrastructure tracker]((https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastucture/issues/new)).
1. You are welcome to follow this up with a Slack message in [#infrastucture](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_infrastructure).
1. Grab some time in my calendar. I use [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/) to manage my calendar. Clockwise will book out free time as "Focus Time".
   Please feel free to book over these blocks.
1. If you cannot find a better alternative, I'm normally okay with meetings in evenings. Early mornings are more difficult due to parental commitments.
