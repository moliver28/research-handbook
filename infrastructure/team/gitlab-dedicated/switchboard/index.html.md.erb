## Summary

The Switchboard is a team within the [Dedicated Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated/). We follow the same processes as listed on the [the Dedicated Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated/), unless a difference exists which is explicitly noted on this page.

## Working with us

To engage with the Switchboard team:

- [Create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/new) in the GitLab Dedicated team issue tracker
- Label the issue with:
  - `component::Switchboard`
  - `workflow-infra::Triage`
  - `team::Switchboard`
- When creating an issue, it is not necessary to `@`mention anyone
- In case you want to get attention, use a specific team handle (Ex: @gitlab-dedicated/switchboard ) as defined in [Dedicated group hierarchy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated/#gitlab-group-hierarchy)
- [Switchboard issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/-/boards/4498935?label_name[]=component%3A%3ASwitchboard) tracks all of the team's current work
- We are in the process of adapting to use the [Product Development Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/)

- Slack channels
  - For Switchboard specific questions, you can find us in [#g_dedicated-switchboard-team](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04DG7DR1LG)
  - Other teams in Dedicated group have their own work channels for team work discussions:
      - [#g_dedicated-team](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C025LECQY0M)
      - [#g_dedicated-us-pubsec](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C03R5837WCV)

## Requesting Access to the Switchboard application

- Create an [Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request) specifying
   - the specific environment ( Test / Beta / Production )
   - level of access required (Readonly, Support, Provisioner, Operator)
   - justification for the access
- Access & Provision Details for the application can be found in the `Switchboard - GitLab Dedicated` section of the [Tech Stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/d3561ab939029faf4ac25f32612c57e861eb8b39/data/tech_stack.yml)

## How we work

### Meetings and Scheduled Calls

Our preference is to work asynchronously, within our project issue tracker as described in [the project management section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated/#project-management).

The team does have a set of regular synchronous calls:

- `Switchboard Sync` - During this call, we are sharing important information for team-members day-to-day, as well as project items requiring a sync discussion
- 1-1s between the Individual Contributors and Engineering Managers

Impromptu Zoom meetings for discussing Switchboard work between individuals are created as needed.
It is expected that these meetings are private streamed, or recorded(1*), and then uploaded to [GitLab Unfiltered playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kp3NBMl7c0DGXCjW5rSPeOK).
The outcome of the call is shared in a persistent location (Slack is not persistent). This is especially important as the team grows, because any decisions that are made in the early stage have will be questioned in the later stages when the team is larger.

`1*` Exceptions to the recording rule are: 1-1 calls, discussions around non-project work, and in cases where parties do not feel comfortable with recording or we cannot record due to the nature of content discussed. However, even with the exceptions, outcome of project related discussions need to be logged in a persistent location, such as the main issue tracker.
