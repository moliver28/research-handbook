## Who We Are

Reliability Engineering is responsible for all of GitLab's user-facing services, with their primary responsibility being GitLab.com. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) ensure the availability of these services, building the tools and automation to monitor and enable this availability. These user-facing services include a multitude of environments, including staging, GitLab.com, and dev.GitLab.org, among others (see the [list of environments](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/)).

## Vision

**Reliability Engineering** ensures that GitLab's customers can rely on GitLab.com for their mission-critical workloads. We approach availability as an engineering challenge and empower our counterparts in Development to make the best possible infrastructure decisions. We own and iterate often on [how we manage incidents](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/) and continually derive and share our learnings by conducting [thorough reviews of those incidents](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-review/).

## Tenets
1. [**Change Management**](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/), [**Incident Management**](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/), [**Incident Review**](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-review/) and [**Delta Management**](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/library/production/deltas/) are owned by Reliability Engineering.
1. Each team member is able to work on all team projects.
1. The team is able to reach conclusions independently all the time, consensus most of the time.
1. Career development paths are clear.
1. The team maintains a database of SRE knowledge through documentation, training sessions, and outreach.
1. We leverage the GitLab product where we can in our toolchain.

## How We Work

We maintain a single source of truth epic for all work underway for the Reliability team. That epic can be found at [GitLab SaaS Reliability - work queue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/509) and represents the current state of project work assigned within squads. That epic references projects detailed in the form of sub-epics.

As Reliability, we have three main work streams and each varies in the type of work. Those three work streams are:
1. [Projects](#how-we-work--projects) - These are pre-planned units of work, managed via an epic and a single DRI who collaborates with other members of Reliability.
1. [EOC Queue](#how-we-work--eoc-queue) - This is a quarterly milestone consisting of corrective actions and EOC tooling maintenance.
1. [Customer Request Queue](#how-we-work--customer-request-queue) - This is a quarterly milestone of all small-scale asks which originate from teams outside of Reliability and which are not tied a Project of corrective action. Examples here include adding DNS entries, provisioning/de-provisioning system access, and assisting Support.

### How We Work -- General Workflow

1. Customers open new issues in [Reliability Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues)
2. New issues are automatically tagged with `workflow-infra::Triage` this label indicates that the issue needs to reviewed and processed.
3. Once tagged as needing to be triaged, issues are reviewed by Reliability SREs and Engineering Managers

#### Reliability Triage Procedures
![Workflow](img/general_workflow.png)

1. Go to the [Reliability Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name[]=workflow-infra%3A%3ATriage) and start with the oldest issue first.
2. Read the issue and get a sense of the type and scope of the work being requested.
3. As part of the triage process, we need to determine if the work being requested is related to a particular project squad.  When it is, we should label appropriately. If you're unsure if an issue should be tagged for a particular project squad, assign the issue to the squad lead and request that they review the issue.  The Squad Lead can determine if the issue makes sense to take on or if it should be considered non-project work.

#### For Project Squad Related Issues
Find the correct label based on the squad name in [Epic 509](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/509).  

The label format is: `ReliabilitySquad::[squadname]`

1. Add the proper Squad Label
2. Add the `For Scheduling` Label.  This indicates that the issue needs to be reviewed by the lead of the assigned squad.
3. Add the `workflow-infra::Ready` label

#### For General Issues not related to Project Squads
1. Add the `reliability-general` label
2. Add the `workflow-infra::Ready` label

### How We Work -- Sources of work

1. Issues generated by customers (teams outside Infrastructure) via one of the paths documented in the [Getting Assistance](#getting-assistance) section. These issues are automatically added to the triage backlog and are processed by Reliability managers.
1. Issues generated as [`Corrective Actions`](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#sts=Corrective%20Actions) for incidents.
1. Issues generated as miscellaneous small tasks found in the day-to-day of an SRE/DBRE/EM
1. Issues generated as part of Project Work.
### Project Squads - [Squad List](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/509)
Projects are assigned and handled within squads. A squad is composed of a minimum of 2 SREs who are responsible for all the sub-epics and issues within a project.
Reliability engineering managers are responsible for the formation of squads and the assignment of projects to the respective squads.

The squad works in a collaborative, transparent approach and uses the strengths of respective SRE to deliver the project in the highest quality within the least amount of time.
Responsibilities of squads:
1. Scope with timelines and deliver on the issues within the assigned epic
1. Assign individual issues within an epic to individual squad members
1. Hold weekly recorded demos, where possible as per the project needs
1. Have a balance of experience and subject matter skills
1. Participate as Infrastructure stable counterparts to other Engineering stage groups
1. Each squad has a lead who keeps the status of the project updated as frequently as necessary, minimum weekly

#### Roles

Squad Lead - See below for more information about this role.
Engineering Manager -  Facilitate communication (upfront context) and strong alignment between squads

Project epics use the following [template](#project-epic-template) in order to capture, current status, DRI, an overview, and any references that help a reader to build context.

Project epics also are labeled with the `team::Reliability` label and either `workflow-infra::Proposal` for projects proposed and not yet begun or `workflow-infra::In Progress` for projects which are underway.

Project epic descriptions have this structure:
1. Status - Current status of the project preceded by the ISO formatted date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the latest status update. Example: "2021-07-20 - DRI selected and initial project sync meeting held."
1. DRI - Directly responsible individual working on the specific issue. This is the GitLab handle of the DRI, `@GitLabHandle`
1. Overview - Narrative description of the project intended to provide additional context. This is a few paragraphs setting context for someone new to the project and wanting to learn more and contribute.
1. Reference - Links out to existing artifacts which allow team members to build context. These are links to documents and any dependent projects or prior art.

#### Squad Lead

The Squad Lead role is one of collaboration and some project management, as well as offering technical guidance to the squad's project(s). It is a technical leadership role, and does not imply an expectation of moving into people management.

The benefits of taking on a Squad Lead role include the development of project management skills, which are useful to have as an IC no matter one's desired career path. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate many of GitLab values (Collaboration, Iteration, Efficiency, Transparency and Results), which can support career growth.

The following guidelines are what we have found lead to effective squads and are offered as a roadmap for Squad Leads taking on the role.

##### Guidelines
1. Coordinate with squad members for planning and tracking work. Through:
    1. Facilitating weekly sync meetings (when possible). Recommended to record. [Example agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14IL8k-3mz8064_J4Ilm_6gNFMgQPKm7OJcgrv84wtJE/edit?usp=sharing)
    1. Async communication using a dedicated slack channel, issues and epics.
    1. Using a dedicated GitLab issue board for tracking issues.
    1. Using milestones to track work in set intervals.
    1. New issue creation and backlog refinement as needed to ensure that new work is available to be picked up.
1. Together with the squad, develop and document workflows.
    1. Include links to meeting agenda and recordings, milestones, slack channel and squad issue board in the project Epic.
    1. If applicable, create a section in the handbook to describe workflows. [Example](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#sts=How%20We%20Work%20–%20Corrective%20Actions%20workflow)
1. Communicate progress on the project epic with a weekly summary comment.
    1. This is one of the most important responsibilities as squad leader.
    1. Consistency is helpful, ie making a progress comment on the same day each week.
    1. Things to include:
        1. Work completed since last update.
        1. Expected work to be completed in the next week.
        1. Any blockers the squad encountered.
        1. Any workflow iteration.
    1. This promotes visibility of progress to stakeholders, as well as provides feedback to the squad for how they are doing.
1. When applicable, schedule recorded demos at the end of each milestone to show progress.
    1. Engineering Manager supporting the squad can act as the stakeholder.
    1. Link to the recordings in the epic.
1. When difficult technical decisions arise, the Squad Lead is the final arbiter.
    1. Gather input, decide, document reasoning, and then act.

The Engineering Manager supporting the squad is always available for questions or other ways to help when needed.

While the above are the Squad Lead's responsibility, that does not mean the Squad Lead must be the one to *do* everything. Delegate and involve your squad members!

#### Milestone

The [squad lead](#roles) can use
[milestone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/#milestones)
under the [`gitlab-com/gl-infra`
](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones) to keep track of
what is going to be achieved in the next block of time.

- **Duration:** It's suggested that the milestone is only for 2 weeks since
that gives individual contributors  enough time to dive deep into an issue and
fix it, but it's not long enough that if we have to pivot because of a change
of priorities it won't disrupt the planning, we don't want to end up in a
situation where we spend a lot of time planning 1 month and then have it change
completely a week in because of a large priority change.
- **Interruption work:** If individual contributors have to work on an issue
outside of the planned milestone they should add it to the milestone that they
are working on. This gives a better overview of what kind of interruptions we
had during that milestone.
- **Issue boards:** If your squad is using [issue
boards](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/boards/) you can edit
the board to be scoped to a specific milestone. Like this, you can keep track
of the progress on the milestone.
- **Number of issues doesn't matter:** The higher the number of issues inside
of the milestone doesn't mean the more productive the squad is.  This is not to
be used as a metric.

What are the benefits?

- Gives the squad a common goal that everyone is clear on what's being worked
on in the coming days.
- Reduce scope, if an issue can't fit in 2 weeks or the milestone duration it's
clear that it's a big issue and needs to be broken down.
- Tracking interruptions.
- Gives a high overview to the engineering manager of what is being worked on.
- Gives a sense of urgency that something needs to be finished in the allocated
time, hopefully, this won't lead to burnout but a discussion about our workload
and a sense that we need to focus on 1 issue at a time.
- A sense of accomplishment, when the milestone is close and the squad looks
back at what achieved in that milestone is can give them a great sense of
accomplishment!

Below are some examples of past milestones that piloted this process:

- [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/153](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/153)
- [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/152](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/152)

### How We Work -- EOC Queue

We maintain a single queue of corrective actions and work which the EOC on duty should fall back to when not actively engaged in incident management. We apply a quarterly milestone to issues in this queue and use a board based on the milestone to indicate priority and where work is at within the workflow.

- [EOC Queue Milestones](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones?search_title=EOC+Queue&state=&sort=)
- [EOC Queue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/boards/2866217)

### How We Work -- Customer Request Queue

We maintain a single queue of active customer requests (asks from other departments are considered customer requests). Work here will be added via a recurring triage process of issues generated from outside the team.

- [Customer Request Queue Milestones](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones?search_title=customer+request+queue&state=&sort=)
- [Customer Request Queue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/boards/2866210)

### How We Work -- Corrective Actions workflow

[Corrective Actions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#corrective-actions) are issues arising from incidents. See the link for the suggested way to create them.

We use [this board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/boards/3164592?label_name[]=corrective%20action&label_name[]=team%3A%3AReliability) to track corrective actions work. Corrective Actions are also an important [performance indicator](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#corrective-action-slo) for the Infrastructure Department.

Currently there is a squad assigned to this work with the focus of 1) refining all open CAs and 2) Burning down the backlog of open CAs.
The slack channel for that squad is #infra-corrective-actions. Anyone is welcome and encouraged to help with the work of CAs.

#### Refinement of open CAs

The process is as follows:
1. Choose an open, unrefined "corrective action" issue (ie it does not have a "ca::refined label") in the GitLab Infrastructure Team project. Add the "workflow-infra::Under Review" label, and assign it to yourself. This ensures that other engineers don't pick up the same issue for refinement asynchronously. Issues with the label "ca::triage" or any of "severity::1", "severity::2", "priority::1", "priority::2" should be prioritized for refinement. [This list](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name[]=corrective%20action&not[label_name][]=ca%3A%3Arefined) can be a useful place to start.
1. Read the issue carefully, including any linked incidents, to get context.
  1. If there is no linked incident, this issue may be mislabeled. Confirm with the issue creator and if there is no incident related to this issue, remove the "corrective action" label. In this case you are done refining this issue.
1. Ensure it has a severity label on it - this is the highest severity of linked incident(s).
1. Ensure it has a priority label on it, indicating the urgency of the issue. For guidance on priority level, see the engineering [triage handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/). When in doubt, feel free to ask the issue creator or other relevant engineers for input.
1. Based on the above, possible actions are:
    1. Cancel the issue by adding the label "workflow-infra::Cancelled" and then closing the issue
        1. Because it is no longer relevant due to other changes in the infrastructure, whether already executed or planned.
        1. You consider it an infrequent enough or low priority problem that you don't think it is currently worth prioritizing the work given the team's current resources.
        1. In either case, add a note to the issue explaining the reason for cancelling.
        1. Don't hesitate to cancel old, low priority CAs. An issue can always be reopened if it is deemed to be an ongoing problem, in which case we can increase the severity/priority and reassess.
    1. Indicate that this CA is ready for work by adding the label "workflow-infra::Ready"
        1. This indicates that the issue is well scoped (to be able to be completed with at most a few days' engineering time), and has the necessary information and context for an engineer to pick up for work.
    1. Promote to an Epic
        1. Sometimes CAs are high priority but very large in scope (more than a few days' worth of work). In this case the CA can be promoted to an Epic. Update the description of the new epic to show that it was created from a CA and make sure that the incident is referenced and linked in that paragraph.
        1. If it falls within the CA squad's scope, leave the Corrective Action label in place. Otherwise remove it with a note.
        1. New issues that are created related to an Epic with a "corrective action" label should not get that label, so as not to artificially inflate the numbers for tracking purposes.
    1. Move to another team/project
        1. Sometimes it becomes clear that a particular corrective action is not an Infrastructure issue. Add a note and move the issue to the appropriate project. If the issue is the responsibility of a stage group, consider adding the `~infradev` label.
    1. Needs more information
        1. If context is missing or scope is unclear, ping the relevant engineers or managers in the issue to gain clarity so that a determination can be made for one of the above four cases. Sometimes we bring issues we need more input on up for discussion at one of our weekly Reliability Discussion meetings for this purpose.
    1. Mark the issue as "workflow-infra::Ready" and add the label "ca::refined" to indicate the CA squad has looked at it. This indicates the issue is A. still relevant B. well scoped C. has enough context for the engineer picking up the issue and D. is ready for work.
1. When refinement is complete and the issue has one of above outcomes, label the issue with "ca::refined" to indicate refinement is completed and remove the "workflow-infra::Under Review" label. Unassign yourself from the issue unless you know you will be the one taking on the work.
1. Sometimes when refining a series of Corrective Action issues, a pattern may emerge that indicates that perhaps project level work is called for. Feel free to create an issue explaining your findings and bring this to the attention of the current DRI for corrective actions and/or an engineering manager.

#### Working on CAs

1. Choose a CA from the Ready column from the above linked board that has no engineer assigned to it. Start with the highest severity/priority level issue that you feel able to take on.
1. Assign yourself to the issue and move it to the "in progress" column or add the label "workflow-infra::In Progress".
1. Reach out to other engineers as needed for more context or pairing. CAs cover a very wide range of infrastructure areas, and you are not expected to know everything. Often it is much more efficient to pair with someone more knowledgable in that domain.
1. When the work is complete, remember to close the issue or move it to the "Done" column.
