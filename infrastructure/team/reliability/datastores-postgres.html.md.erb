## Mission
To support, maintain, and improve services related to our [PostgreSQL datastores](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/#database-architecture).

## Vision
In support of our mission we'll increase the amount of orchestration and automation used in order to reduce toil and make projects more [boring](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/teamops/decision-velocity/#boring-solutions).

## Ownership

### Services
Systems and services we are primarily responsible for:
  * PostgreSQL Core
  * PostgreSQL High Availability and Load Balancing (e.g. Patroni, PGBouncer, consul, PostgreSQL Replication etc.)
  * PostgreSQL Disaster Recovery (backup/restore and other techniques)
  * Database Observability (Prometheus instrumentation, workload analysis etc.)
  * Support & troubleshooting of GitLab applications, specifically related to their use of and interaction with the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

Systems or services explicitly not owned by us:
| System name | Description | Owner and supported by | Extra info/Open questions |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Redis | There are several use cases such as caching, rate-limiting, sidekiq queueing. | [Scalability Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/scalability/) | [Redis Architecture](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/#redis-architecture) |
| Clickhouse |  |  |  |
| Data team systems |          | Data team |                          |
| Self Managed databases|           | Self managed Support |               |

## Performance Indicators
The signals we use to know that we are achieving our mission:
  * Related quarterly OKRs (TBC)
  * Relavent [performance and availability indicators](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/infrastructure/database-reliability-engineer/#performance-indicators)

## Team Members
TBD

## Key Technical Skills
The team is comprised of DBREs predominantly, with one to two SREs. So while the key technical skills differ between roles to some extent, there are a common set of skills which both roles require, to differing levels:
  * Experience supporting PostgreSQL in large production environments.
  * Infrastucture automation and configuration management using tools such as Chef, Ansible, Terraform, etc.
  * Knowledge of PostgreSQL internals, SQL and PL/pgSQL.
