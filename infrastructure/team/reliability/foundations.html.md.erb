## Mission

The Reliability:Foundations team at GitLab mission is to Build, Run and Own the entire lifecycle of the core infrastructure for GitLab.com to allow Infrastructure, Development & Product teams to build their services for GitLab.com.

The team is focused on owning the reliability, scalability, and security of the existing core infrastructure, introducing new capabilities that enable other teams to self serve core infrastructure more efficiently/effectively run their services for GitLab.com and reducing the effort required to provide our core infrastructure services.

Other teams include in their missions to build their services on top of the services provided by Reliability:Foundations so we should be looking to make their consumption of our services as simple as possible.

The team should be seeking to build their services on top of GitLab features and cloud vendor managed products to reduce complexity, improve efficiency and deliver new capabilities quicker where they are the right choice.

The team does not explicitly have any product responsibilities but we should contribute the lessons we learn running at scale production systems back to the product teams and we should advocate for GitLab to contain features that would allow us to DogFood.

## Vision

The Foundations Team supports the rest of Infrastructure and Development by providing the resources that other teams build upon. We do so by working collaboratively, iteratively, and striking the right balance between delivering results quickly yet safely.

## Ownership

### Overlap

Given the nature of this team's scope, several services the Foundation team works with are either co-owned by other teams or impact their work.
