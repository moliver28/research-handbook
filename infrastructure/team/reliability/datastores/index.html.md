## Who We Are

The Datastores team owns our persistent storage platforms, namely our PostgreSQL databases (our main priority) and our Gitaly backend service.

PostgreSQL Databases we look after in Gitlab:
- Staging cluster.
- Production cluster.
- Archive and Delayed production replicas.
- Cloud SQL cluster in ops.gitlab.net.
- Prefect Cloud SQL databases, staging and production clusters.

Other components we take care of, as part of the Database ecosystem in Gitlab:
- Patroni templates.
- Consul (running on the Database clusters).
- PG Bouncer connection pooler.


Main Gitaly components we work on:
- Repo File servers.
- Praefect - as part of our [Gitaly Cluster architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html).
- Gitaly Rails App and nodes.

## Vision

*WIP*

## Tenets

- Data integrity and consistency are our top priority - GitLab.com depends very much on that.
- Automation as a way to run things with no manual intervention in production. All of our production changes are run via code.
- Reliability of our datastores, also top priority. As part of the Reliability group we endeavour to run GitLab.com with 99.95% (or higher) availability - our Datastores availability should enable that goal.
- We don’t want to fix things twice: If anything is broken, take your time to find a permanent (code based) solution, test it and roll it to production.
- Growth mindset: we believe that our abilities can grow with effort and persistence. Goals are opportunities to grow. the purpose of what you do every day is to improve.
- Obsession about avoiding service incidents, and fast-mitigation if they do happen.
