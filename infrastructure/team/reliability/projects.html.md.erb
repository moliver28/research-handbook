# Reliability Projects
This page provides an overview of how the Reliability Team works on projects.

## Project Squads  - [Squad List](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/509)
Definition: A squad refers to a smaller group of SREs within the Infrastructure Reliability team, who are responsible for all the sub-epics and issues within a project. It is similar to what we refer to as Groups within other GitLab teams.
Squad membership crosses Infrastructure Reliability teams, but does not extend past the Infrastructure Reliability sub-department.
Reliability engineering managers are responsible for forming the squads and assigning projects.

The squad works in a collaborative, transparent approach and uses the strengths of respective SRE to deliver the project in the highest quality within the least amount of time.
Responsibilities of squads:
1. Scope with timelines and deliver on the issues within the assigned epic
1. Assign individual issues within an epic to individual squad members
1. Hold weekly recorded demos, where possible as per the project needs
1. Have a balance of experience and subject matter skills
1. Participate as Infrastructure stable counterparts to other Engineering stage groups
1. Each squad has a lead who keeps the status of the project updated as frequently as necessary, minimum weekly

## Roles

Squad DRI - See below for more information about this role.
Engineering Manager -  Facilitate communication (upfront context) and strong alignment between squads

Project epics use the following [template](#project-epic-template) in order to capture, current status, DRI, an overview, and any references that help a reader to build context.

### Squad DRI

The Squad DRI role is one of collaboration and some project management, as well as offering technical guidance to the squad's project(s). It is a technical leadership role, and does not imply an expectation of moving into people management.

The benefits of taking on a Squad DRI role include the development of project management skills, which are useful to have as an IC no matter one's desired career path. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate many of GitLab values (Collaboration, Iteration, Efficiency, Transparency and Results), which can support career growth.

The following guidelines are what we have found lead to effective squads and are offered as a roadmap for Squad DRIs taking on the role.

#### Guidelines
1. Coordinate with squad members for planning and tracking work. Through:
    1. Facilitating weekly sync meetings (when possible). Recommended to record. [Example agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14IL8k-3mz8064_J4Ilm_6gNFMgQPKm7OJcgrv84wtJE/edit?usp=sharing)
    1. Async communication using a dedicated slack channel, issues and epics.
    1. Using a dedicated GitLab issue board for tracking issues.
    1. Using milestones to track work in set intervals.
    1. New issue creation and backlog refinement as needed to ensure that new work is available to be picked up.
1. Together with the squad, develop and document workflows.
    1. Include links to meeting agenda and recordings, milestones, slack channel and squad issue board in the project Epic.
    1. If applicable, create a section in the handbook to describe workflows. [Example](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#sts=How%20We%20Work%20â€“%20Corrective%20Actions%20workflow)
1. Communicate progress on the project epic with a weekly summary comment.
    1. This is one of the most important responsibilities as Squad DRI.
    1. Consistency is helpful, ie making a progress comment on the same day each week.
    1. Things to include:
        1. Work completed since last update.
        1. Expected work to be completed in the next week.
        1. Any blockers the squad encountered.
        1. Any workflow iteration.
    1. This promotes visibility of progress to stakeholders, as well as provides feedback to the squad for how they are doing.
1. When applicable, schedule recorded demos at the end of each milestone to show progress.
    1. Engineering Manager supporting the squad can act as the stakeholder.
    1. Link to the recordings in the epic.
1. When difficult technical decisions arise, the Squad DRI is the final arbiter.
    1. Gather input, decide, document reasoning, and then act.

The Engineering Manager supporting the squad is always available for questions or other ways to help when needed.

While the above are the Squad DRI's responsibility, that does not mean the Squad DRI must be the one to *do* everything. Delegate and involve your squad members!

### Project Epic Template

We use [automation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/epic-issue-summaries) to roll up status reports into the [Reliability tracking epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/509).
It is important that the following is done on every epic so that status will be shown properly when it is updated

1. In the epic description, there is a single line that designates the DRI. eg: `DRI: @username`
1. In the epic description, there is a heading named Status followed by the current date eg: `## Status YYYY-MM-DD`. This section should be updated weekly with a short high level summary (one or two sentences) that will help management and team members outside of Reliability understand the current progress. This needs to be brief because it is rolled up into a table in the parent epic.

```markdown
DRI: <!-- GitLab username for the DRI -->

## Status YYYY-MM-DD

<!-- Status summary, one or two sentences that is meant for management and team members outside of reliability.

     Example:

       ## Status 2022-02-02

       This week we rolled out the latest update to this amazing component, the squad had a few setbacks that will be overcome in the next few weeks.
-->

### Additional status sections (optional)

<!-- Additional status updates underneath headings. For example, what was shipped, what is in progress, blockers, etc.
     This part won't be rolled up into the parent epic.

     Example:

       ### Details

        - Update `2.27.1` was rolled out to GPRD successfully.
        - Issue #44 was closed after the team agreed to cancel the work.
        - Issue #45 was completed successfully.
-->

### Overview

<!-- Overview of the project and its goals -->

### Reference (optional)

<!-- Links to boards, blueprints, readiness, or anything else relevant to the project -->
```

### Project Epic Labels

At a minimum, every Reliability epic should have `~workflow-infra::` scoped label:

1. `workflow-infra::In Progress`: Actively being worked on by Reliability team members.
1. `workflow-infra::Proposal`: Proposed work that is not yet ready to start.
1. `workflow-infra::Stalled`: Work that was in progress, but has stopped due to priority shifts or other reasons.
1. `workflow-infra::Ready`: Work that is ready to start, but not yet scheduled.
1. `workflow-infra::Blocked`: Work that is blocked by other work that needs to get done, or by dependencies outside of Reliability.
1. `workflow-infra::Done`: Work that was finished to completion.
1. `workflow-infra::Cancelled`: Work that is canceled that will most likely not continue.

### Milestone

The [squad dri](#roles) can use
[milestone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/#milestones)
under the [`gitlab-com/gl-infra`
](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones) to keep track of
what is going to be achieved in the next block of time.

- **Duration:** It's suggested that the milestone is only for 2 weeks since
that gives individual contributors  enough time to dive deep into an issue and
fix it, but it's not long enough that if we have to pivot because of a change
of priorities it won't disrupt the planning, we don't want to end up in a
situation where we spend a lot of time planning 1 month and then have it change
completely a week in because of a large priority change.
- **Interruption work:** If individual contributors have to work on an issue
outside of the planned milestone they should add it to the milestone that they
are working on. This gives a better overview of what kind of interruptions we
had during that milestone.
- **Issue boards:** If your squad is using [issue
boards](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/boards/) you can edit
the board to be scoped to a specific milestone. Like this, you can keep track
of the progress on the milestone.
- **Number of issues doesn't matter:** The higher the number of issues inside
of the milestone doesn't mean the more productive the squad is.  This is not to
be used as a metric.

What are the benefits?

- Gives the squad a common goal that everyone is clear on what's being worked
on in the coming days.
- Reduce scope, if an issue can't fit in 2 weeks or the milestone duration it's
clear that it's a big issue and needs to be broken down.
- Tracking interruptions.
- Gives a high overview to the engineering manager of what is being worked on.
- Gives a sense of urgency that something needs to be finished in the allocated
time, hopefully, this won't lead to burnout but a discussion about our workload
and a sense that we need to focus on 1 issue at a time.
- A sense of accomplishment, when the milestone is close and the squad looks
back at what achieved in that milestone is can give them a great sense of
accomplishment!

Below are some examples of past milestones that piloted this process:
