### What is the Development Director Shadow Experiment?

I got massive value out of participating in our [CEO Shadow Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/shadow/) when [I did it in July of 2020](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/07/08/ceo-shadow-impressions-takeaways/).

Since then, I have been thinking of doing something, but smaller scale in engineering.  In July of 2021 I asked my teams if they would be interested in remotely shadowing me and a number of team members expressed interest as they wanted to learn what I do, how I do it, and how I make decisions.

I am doing an experiment for a couple months with a smaller scope and smaller scale shadow program than the CEO Shadow Program, open to anyone in engineering.  If it goes well, I will continue it and iterateively improve it.  If it doesn't go well, I will end it.

### Who can apply to be a part of the program?

* This program is currently open to any team member on our engineering team.  If it is successful it will be opened up to the rest of the company.

### Process for requesitng to be a shadow

1. I am in the Eastern US (GMT-4).  The shadow must be available during some (but not all) of these working hours.  Confirm this works for you before proceeding.
1. Check this spreadsheet TBD for days that are open for shadowing
1. Confirm with your manager (as appropriate) that they are ok with you participating
1. Add yourself to the spreadsheet for the days in whcih you want to shadow
1. Slack me in `#wayne_shadow_program_experiment` to let me know a couple days before your first shadow
1. Schedule a coffee chat with me a couple days before your first shadow (especially if we have not met previously)

### Process for being a shadow

* The shadowing will be done remotely.
* You can be a shadow for as little as one day or as much as five days in a six month period
* The shadowing does not need to be done on sequential days
* Join all meetings on my calendar on your shadow days that are not private (most are not private), unless I speciifcally ask you not to because the meeting participants have opted out of this program for this meeting.
* Review all documents, issues, merge requests, etc linked to the meetings that you have access to
* If you don't have access to a document and the meeting participants are ok with allowing you to view it (which I will confirm), I will share my screen via Google Hangout or will grant you temporary access to the document
* You are encouraged to take notes in meeting documents that you have edit rights to (which will be most of them)
* You may be asked to drop from a meeting when something confidential needs to be shown or discussed
* Ask me questions via Slack in `#wayne_shadow_program_experiment`, after a meeting concludes, via scheduling a meeting with me, or via an ad-hoc Zoom discussion.
* After your shadow completes, I would love to hear feedback on the program, on what you learned, on what you liked, on what you didn't like, feedback on what I can do better, etc.

## Process for non-shadow meeting attendees

* If a meeting is public inside GitLab, shadows will simply attend the meeting as a regular participant
* If a meeting discusses or shows confidential information, I will ask the meeting owner and/or participants if they are ok with a shadow being in the meeting.
