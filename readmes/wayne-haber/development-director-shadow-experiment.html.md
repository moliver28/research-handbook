### What is the Development Director Shadow Experiment?

I got massive value out of participating in our [CEO Shadow Program](/handbook/ceo/shadow/) when [I did it in July of 2020](/blog/2020/07/08/ceo-shadow-impressions-takeaways/).

Since then, I have been thinking of doing something similar but smaller in scale.  In July of 2021, I asked my teams if they would be interested in remotely shadowing me and several team members expressed interest as they wanted to learn what I do, how I do it, and how I make decisions.

I am experimenting for a couple of months with a smaller scope and smaller-scale shadow program than the CEO Shadow Program.  If it goes well, I will continue it and iteratively improve it.  If it doesn't go well, I will end it.


### Process for requesting to be a shadow

1. I am in the Eastern US (GMT-4).  The shadow must be available during some (but not all) of these working hours.  Confirm this works for you before proceeding.
1. You have been with GitLab for at least one month
1. Check the schedule below for weeks that are `Open` for shadowing.
1. Obtain written approval from your manager that they are ok with you participating, as your workload will need to be reduced for the shadow program duration.
1. Add yourself to the table for the weeks in which you want to shadow via an MR

### How does the shadowing work?

* The shadow will participate remotely.
* You can be a shadow for as little as one week or as much as two weeks in a six month period.  The weeks do not need to be sequential.
* Join all meetings on my calendar on your shadow week that are not private (most are not private), unless I ask you not to because the meeting participants have opted out of this program for this meeting.
* If you are so inclined, review all documents, issues, and merge requests linked to the meetings that you have access to.
* If you don't have access to a document and the meeting participants are ok with allowing you to view it (which I will confirm), I will share my screen via Google Hangouts or will grant you temporary access to the document.
* You are encouraged to take notes on what is being said in meeting documents that you have edit rights to (which will be most of them).  The goal of the notes is to collect the main points and outcomes, not a full transcript of the conversation. As you are taking notes, be mindful that the goal of the program is to absorb what is being said in the meetings you are in.
* You may be asked to drop from a meeting when something confidential needs to be shown or discussed
* Feel free to ask me questions via Slack in `#wayne_shadow_program`, after a meeting concludes, via scheduling a meeting with me, or via an ad-hoc Zoom discussion.
* If you are so inclined, review my [GitLab history](https://gitlab.com/whaber) and Slack messages I have written in public channels.
* Shadows can choose to be aware of the current time and providing timekeeping in meetings. This is for meeting participants to comfortably wrap up the meeting.
* If you notice Wayne interrupting speakers, speaking too quickly, or not pausing often enough, please let him know.  These are things he is working on improving.
* Feel free to introduce yourself in a meeting when you feel this is appropriate (especially when there are a small number of attendees and/or the meeting is not public inside GitLab).  Tell participants who you are, what your normal job is, and that you are a shadow in this meeting. 
* Even in meetings where you are unfamiliar with the subject matter, there is an opportunity to learn, document, and shape the evolution of GitLab's [values](/handbook/values/). 

## Process for non-shadow meeting attendees

* If a meeting is public inside GitLab, shadows will simply attend the meeting as a regular participant
* Some meetings will discuss confidential information. In those cases, I will ask the meeting owner and/or participants if they are ok with a shadow being in the meeting (and if they are ok with the shadow having read and/or read/write access to the meeting notes document).

## What this program is not

It is not a performance evaluation or a step for a future promotion.

## Benefits for the company

* Mentoring and learning opportunities for the shadow
* Reverse mentorship learning for Wayne
* Career development exploration

## Preparing for the program

1. Slack me in `#wayne_shadow_program` to let me know a couple of days before your first shadow
1. Schedule a coffee chat with me a couple of days before your first shadow (especially if we have not met previously)
1. Plan to observe and ask questions
1. Don't plan to do your normal amount of usual work.  You should reduce your workload by at least 75% during the shadowing time period.
1. Participating in the shadow program is a privilege where you may be exposed to confidential information. This is underpinned by trust in the shadows to honor the confidentiality of topics being discussed and information shared. The continuation of this program is entirely dependent on shadows past, present, and future honoring this trust placed in them.
1. Review my calendar (link TBD)
1. Review my [readme](/handbook/engineering/readmes/wayne-haber/) 
1. Re-read GitLab's values prior to your shadow rotation, and be mindful of new and inventive ways that [CREDIT](/handbook/values/#credit) is lived out during the meetings you attend.

## What to do after you participate

1. After your shadow completes, I would love to hear feedback on the program, what you learned, what you liked, what you didn't like, feedback on what I can do better, etc.
1. Consider sharing your learnings with your team and other peers via a blog, slack summary, etc.

## Are other directors in engineering also allowing shadows?

No, not at this time.
