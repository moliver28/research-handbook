### What is the Development Director Shadow Experiment?

I got massive value out of participating in our [CEO Shadow Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/shadow/) when [I did it in July of 2020](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/07/08/ceo-shadow-impressions-takeaways/).

Since then, I have been thinking of doing something, but smaller scale in engineering.  In July of 2021 I asked my teams if they would be interested in remotely shadowing me and a number of team members expressed interest as they wanted to learn what I do, how I do it, and how I make decisions.

I am doing an experiment for a couple months with a smaller scope and smaller scale shadow program than the CEO Shadow Program, open to anyone in engineering.  If it goes well, I will continue it and iterateively improve it.  If it doesn't go well, I will end it.

### Who can apply to be a part of the program?

* This program is currently open to any team member on our engineering team.  If it is successful it will be opened up to the rest of the company.

### Process for requesitng to be a shadow

1. I am in the Eastern US (GMT-4).  The shadow must be available during some (but not all) of these working hours.  Confirm this works for you before proceeding.
1. You have been a GitLab team member for >= 3 months
1. Check this spreadsheet TBD for days that are open for shadowing.  If this program is successful the spreadsheet will be replaced with a handbook table.
1. Confirm with your manager (as appropriate) that they are ok with you participating
1. Add yourself to the spreadsheet for the days in whcih you want to shadow

### How does the shadowing work?

* The shadowing will be done remotely.
* You can be a shadow for as little as one day or as much as five days in a six month period.  The shadowing does not need to be done on sequential days
* Join all meetings on my calendar on your shadow days that are not private (most are not private), unless I speciifcally ask you not to because the meeting participants have opted out of this program for this meeting.
* If you are so inclined, review all documents, issues, merge requests, etc linked to the meetings that you have access to
* If you don't have access to a document and the meeting participants are ok with allowing you to view it (which I will confirm), I will share my screen via Google Hangouts or will grant you temporary access to the document
* You are encouraged to take notes on what is being said in meeting documents that you have edit rights to (which will be most of them).  The goal of the notes is to collect the main points and outcomes, not a full transcript of the conversation. As you are taking notes, be mindful that the goal of the program is to absorb what is being said in the meetings you are in.
* You may be asked to drop from a meeting when something confidential needs to be shown or discussed
* Feel free to ask me questions via Slack in `#wayne_shadow_program_experiment`, after a meeting concludes, via scheduling a meeting with me, or via an ad-hoc Zoom discussion.
* If you are so inclined, review my GitLab history (link TBD) and Slack messages I have written in public channels (link TBD).
* Shadows can choose to be aware of the current time and providing timekeeping in meetings. This is for meeting participants to comfortably wrap up the meeting.
* If you notice Wayne interrupting speakers, speaking too quickly, or not pausing often enough, please let him know.  These are things he is working on improving.
* Feel free to introduce yourself in a meeting when you feel this is appropriate (especially when there are a small number of attendees and/or the meeting is not public inside GitLab).  Tell participants who you are, what your normal job is, and that you are a shadow in this meeting. 
* Even in meetings where you are unfamiliar with the subject matter, there is opportunity to learn, document, and shape the evolution of GitLab's [values](https://whaber-master-patch-09926.about.gitlab-review.app/handbook/values/). Re-read GitLab's values prior to your CEO Shadow rotation, and be mindful of new and inventive ways that [CREDIT](https://whaber-master-patch-09926.about.gitlab-review.app/handbook/values/#credit) is lived out during the meetings you attend.

## Process for non-shadow meeting attendees

* If a meeting is public inside GitLab, shadows will simply attend the meeting as a regular participant
* If a meeting discusses or shows confidential information, I will ask the meeting owner and/or participants if they are ok with a shadow being in the meeting (and if they are ok with the shadow having read and/or read/write access to the meeting notes document).

## What this program is not

It is not a performance evaluation or a step for a future promotion.

## Benefits for the company

* Mentoring and learning opportunities for the shadow
* Reverse mentorship learning for Wayne

## Preparing for the program

1. Slack me in `#wayne_shadow_program_experiment` to let me know a couple days before your first shadow
1. Schedule a coffee chat with me a couple days before your first shadow (especially if we have not met previously)
1. Plan to observe and ask questions
1. Don't plan to your normal amount of usual work.  You should reduce your workload by at least 75% during the shadowing time period.
1. Participating in the shadow program is a privilege where you may be exposed to confidential information. This is underpinned by trust in the shadows to honor the confidentiality of topics being discussed and information shared. The continuation of this program is entirely dependent on shadows past, present, and future honoring this trust placed in them.
1. Review my calendar (link TBD)
1. Review my [readme](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/readmes/wayne-haber/) 

## What to do after you participate

1. After your shadow completes, I would love to hear feedback on the program, on what you learned, on what you liked, on what you didn't like, feedback on what I can do better, etc.
1. Consider sharing your learnings with your team and other peers via a blog, slack summary, etc.
