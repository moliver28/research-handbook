## Daniel Diniz's README

**Daniel Diniz - Support Engineer (EMEA)**

Hey! My name is Daniel Diniz and this is the first interation on a personal README document.

The goal of writing this document is simply writing in itself, and it's pulibshed for anyone interested in a glimpse into who I am. A wise person once said:

> Meditate to heal the mind.

> Read to expand the mind.

> Write to clarify the mind.

## About me

I'm passionate about life itself. I love learning new things, preferably on a daily basis. I like it so much that if I would have to name one goal in life, it would be to become a full-time learner.

Here are some things I'm particularly passionate about:
  - Movement (of the body).
  - Music.
  - Carpentry.
  - Technology.

I believe that the magic pill everyone seeks is called 'good habits'. Here are a couple of things that I like doing _every day_:
  - Going for a walk.
  - Writing.
  - Spending time alone in silence.
  - At least one deep, meaningful conversation with someone I love.
  - Some deep, focused work.
  -A good night's sleep

## Personally

- I currently live in the beautiful Netherlands, but I'm originally from Brazil. 
- Two of my best friends are actually not human. I spend dumb amounts of time with my two dogs, Kiss and Ravi.
- I am a 'sea' person. I'm the happiest version of myself when on walking distance from a seashore.

## Things I don't care about you:

Your age, skin color, political beliefs, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, alma mater, past mistakes, how much you earn.

## Things I care about you:

Your integrity, who you are today, whether you try to make society a better place.
