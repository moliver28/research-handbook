As GitLab continues to grow and mature, it is approaching a pivotal point in which faster growth across multiple large sites and a focus on the enterprise will become the main challenges to contend with over the next 12 months. We will need to do far more with less, and we will need to do it both better and more predictably than ever so we can comfortably achieve meet our goals, paerticularly in regards to availability. 

Therefore, over the next 12 months, our most critical technical strategic investment will be the full transition to **Cloud Native** on stateless components (which is reflected by its #2 position on the [Biggest Tailwinds](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/biggest-tailwinds/)), closely followed by our ability to operate and fine tune a variety of configurations at scale, all while doing so with frugality and continuing to innovate feature-wise.
