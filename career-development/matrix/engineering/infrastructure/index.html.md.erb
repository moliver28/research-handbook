## Infrastructure Department Career Framework

The Infrastructure Department Career Framework consists of three major components:

1. Company Values Alignment
1. Engineering Function Leadership Competencies
1. Infrastructure Department Leadership and Technical Competencies

Each of these three components hold equal importance for team member professional development at GitLab.

For each job family, regardless of the level, in the Infrastructure department we are looking to grow team member skills:

1. Accountability - Describes expected level of responsibility
1. Credibility - Describes expected level of trust
1. Autonomy - Describes how a team member can shape their own and their teamâ€™s work
1. Team building - Describes how a team member helps grow their team

The expected team member competencies in the Infrastructure department at GitLab can be seen at the job level:

1. [Intermediate](/handbook/engineering/career-development/matrix/engineering/infrastructure/intermediate)
1. Senior
1. Staff
1. Distinguished
1. Engineering Fellow

## Infrastructure specialties

To be added.
