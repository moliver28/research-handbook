##### Quality

| Responsibility | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Test Planning & Coverage | **Own test planning efforts and proactively optimize test coverage** <br/> * Create test plans and implement test automation for new features. Coach other Software Engineers in Test in effective and thoughtful test planning methods. <br/> * Proactively manage the competing priorities and potential collisions of concurrent projects to reduce risk, increase test coverage, and leverage efficiency gains in overlapping testing activities. <br/> * Identify and design potential new test frameworks, demonstrate their value, and implement in collaboration with other Software Engineers in Test. <br/> * Provide risk analysis and input on test strategy, refine tests at all levels to ensure efficient coverage and effective deduplication, and steer the team to optimal test coverage.|
| Test Stability & Triage | **Proactively manage triage and test pipeline stabilization activities** <br/> * Participate in test pipeline on-call rotation and ensure that pipeline failures are triaged and addressed in a timely manner. <br/> * Clearly communicate status updates to the team. <br/> * Take ownership of unquarantining flaky tests. Help debug failures to unblock the current on-call engineers.<br/> * Work wth Infrastructure and the counterpart stage to address test failures related to test environments or bugs in code. <br/> * Identify and implement improvements to the process to make it more efficient. Proactively identify and implement improvements to our test architecture to improve stability and reduce flakiness. |
| Test Tooling | Regularly lead discussions on architectural improvements of test tooling and infrastructure. |
| Test Environments | Lead test automation infrastructure implementation across multiple product areas in collaboration with stage group and functional area counterparts. |
|Task Management & OKRs | **Work on complex department initiatives that have an impact on the company's bottom line**<br/> * Owns an OKR. <br/> * Define and independently manages multiple projects within the department. <br/> * Able to create new methods for obtaining results. <br/> * Analyze engineering metrics and make suggestions to improve engineering processes and velocity. <br/> * Contributes to working groups as a Quality lead." |
| Knowledge Sharing | * Regularly author and review new content from the department to the company blog and handbook. <br/> * Mentors other engineers. <br/> * Participate in customer calls and take part in Engineering outreach. |
| Domain specific expertise | * Demonstrate domain specific responsibilities within their assigned product group |
