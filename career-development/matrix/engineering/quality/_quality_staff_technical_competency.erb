##### Quality
* Coach other Software Engineers in Test in effective and thoughtful test planning methods.
* Proactively manage the competing priorities and potential collisions of concurrent projects to reduce risk, increase test coverage, and leverage efficiency gains in overlapping testing activities. 
* Identify and design potential new test frameworks, demonstrate their value, and implement in collaboration with other Software Engineers in Test.
* Provide risk analysis and input on test strategy, refine tests at all levels to ensure efficient coverage and effective deduplication, and steer the team to optimal test coverage.
* Participate in test pipeline on-call rotation and ensure that pipeline failures are triaged and addressed in a timely manner. 
* Help debug failures to unblock the current on-call engineers.
* Work wth Infrastructure and the counterpart stage to address test failures related to test environments or bugs in code.
* Proactively identify and implement improvements to our test architecture to improve stability and reduce flakiness.
* Regularly lead discussions on architectural improvements of test tooling and infrastructure.
* Lead test automation infrastructure implementation across multiple product areas in collaboration with stage group and functional area counterparts.
* Define and independently manages multiple projects within the department. 
* Able to create new methods for obtaining results. 
* Analyze engineering metrics and make suggestions to improve engineering processes and velocity.
* Contributes to working groups as a Quality lead.
* Regularly author and review new content from the department to the company blog and handbook.
* Mentors other engineers on best practices. 
* Participate in customer calls and take part in Engineering outreach. 
* Advocates for quality and makes sure it is everyone's responsibility.
* Holds MRs to the high standards and collaborate with others to improve their implementation, tests and prevent any future regressions.
* Advocates for tech debt, customer issues, and high severity bugs.
* Able to quickly pivot a solution based on feedback or complexity.
* Acts as a gate keeper for quality as a Maintainer of your team's primary project (usually GitLab CE & EE).
