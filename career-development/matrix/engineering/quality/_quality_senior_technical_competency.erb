##### Quality

| Responsibility | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Test Planning & Coverage | **Lead test planning efforts and optimize test coverage** <br/> * Create test plans and implement test automation for new features. <br/> *Provide risk analysis and input on test strategy. Identify and communicate must-have test coverage for critical functionality. <br/> * Refine tests at all levels to ensure efficient coverage and effective deduplication. <br/> * Steer the team to optimal test coverage by identifying gaps in functional and non-functional test automation, documenting missing coverage, and adding new test automation to improve coverage. |
| Test Stability & Triage | **Lead triage and test pipeline stabilization activities** <br /> * Participate in test pipeline on-call rotation and ensure that pipeline failures are triaged and addressed in a timely manner. <br/> * Clearly communicate status updates to the team. <br/> * Take ownership of unquarantining flaky tests. <br/> * Work wth Infrastructure and the counterpart group to address test failures related to test environments or bugs in code. <br/> * Identify and implement improvements to the process to make it more efficient. |
| Test Tooling | * Lead test stability resolution efforts for tests in production and non-production environments. <br/> * Lead and implement new test infrastucture tooling. <br/> * Optimize test pipelines to reduce feedback cycle. <br/> * Take initiative to recommend new approaches and processes that will improve our quality, productivity, and velocity. |
| Test Environments | * Setup and maintain new GitLab test environments for your stable counterpart group. <br/> * Leverage provisioning technologies (e.g. Omnibus, the Orchestrator, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, GCP, or AWS) and work with infrastructure and distribution teams as needed. |
|Task Management & OKRs | * Owns KRs within team OKRs. <br/> * Establish due dates and approach for completing assignments; demonstrates project management skills as part of a larger team. <br/> * Exercises judgment and independently identifies the next steps. <br/> * Works closely with counterparts to anticipate, understand, and plan for upcoming work and roadblocks. <br/> * Contributes to progress of working group exit criteria |
| Knowledge Sharing | * Clearly document, review, and broadly share our process and knowledge. <br/> * Contribute to publishing external content like GitLab blogs on interesting problems solved. <br/> * Record demos and walk-throughs. <br/> * Mentor other engineers. |
| Domain specific expertise | * Demonstrate domain specific responsibilities within their assigned product group |
