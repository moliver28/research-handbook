## How we work

### Sync Meetings

We try to [work async](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) as much as possible. However, there are occasions where synchronous communication might be better suited for the task. Our Weekly Team Sync meeting is one of those occasions where we can celebrate wins, collaborate quickly over a number of issues, and generally have some facetime in an all-remote environment.

#### Times and Timezones

The Utilization Team meets weekly on Tuesdays alternating each week between at 9:30 AM (6:30 AM PT // 2:30 PM UTC) and 4:00 PM US Eastern Time (1:00 PM PT // 9:00 PM UTC // Wednesday 10 AM NZT) to accomodate teammates in their timezones via Zoom.

#### Recording Meetings

Using the `[REC]` meeting prefix, the meeting is automatically uploaded to Google Drive into the GitLab Videos Recorded folder in Google Drive on an hourly basis via a scheduled pipeline. All teammates are set as alternate hosts and should be able to record the meeting is the Engineering Manager is not present. The recording link will be placed into the agenda after the recording is available.

#### Meeting Preparation

All team members are encouraged to add topics to the [weekly agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Fdt-tx1_G1NFoAPv6wU5BeEQeXsPq1UZXkIPfuF3Vk/edit?usp=sharing) async. In the unlikely event that the agenda is empty, we'll cancel the meeting.
