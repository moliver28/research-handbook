## How we work

### Sync Meetings

We try to [work async](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) as much as possible. However, there are occasions where synchronous communication might be better suited for the task. Our Weekly Team Sync meeting is one of those occasions where we can celebrate wins, collaborate quickly over a number of issues, and generally have some face-time in an all-remote environment.

#### Times and Timezones

The Utilization Team meets weekly on Tuesdays alternating each week between at 9:30 AM (6:30 AM PT // 2:30 PM UTC) and 4:00 PM US Eastern Time (1:00 PM PT // 9:00 PM UTC // Wednesday 10 AM NZT) to accommodate teammates in their timezones via Zoom.

#### Recording Meetings

Using the `[REC]` meeting prefix, the meeting is automatically uploaded into the [GitLab Videos Recorded folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0APOeuCQrsm4KUk9PVA) on an hourly basis via a scheduled pipeline. All teammates are set as alternate hosts and should be able to record the meeting is the Engineering Manager is not present. The recording link will be placed into the agenda after the recording is available.

#### Meeting Preparation

All team members are encouraged to add topics to the [weekly agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Fdt-tx1_G1NFoAPv6wU5BeEQeXsPq1UZXkIPfuF3Vk/edit?usp=sharing) async. In the unlikely event that the agenda is empty, we'll cancel the meeting.

### Async Updates

#### Engineers

Engineers are responsible for providing async issue updates on active, assigned issues when progress is made. Following the [template and guidance](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/#weekly-async-issue-updates) for async updates for the entire Fulfillment Sub-department, updates should be made at least weekly. These updates help keep collaborators, stakeholders, and community contributors informed on the progress of an issue.

#### Engineering Manager

##### Milestones

The Engineering Manager will report before the end of each week on milestone progress in the current milestone planning issue on the following topics:

```
**Total Weight Closed** XX

**Total Weight Open** XX (XX in dev)

**Deliverable Weight Closed** XX

**Deliverable Weight Open** X (XX in dev;  X blocked)

**Blocked Issues** X issue(s) (X weight) link, description
```

##### OKRs

The Engineering Manager will report on the progress of [OKRs](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/) every two weeks. Current OKRs: [FY22-Q1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/10680)

### Taking Time Off (PTO)

It is important to [take time off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#paid-time-off) so that you can rest, reset, avoid burnout, take care of loved ones, etc. You are encouraged to take time for yourself or your family following our sub-value of [Friends and Family First, work second](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second).

When going out of office, please be sure to [clearly communicate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off) your availability with other people. The following steps are required when submitting a PTO notification.

1. In [PTO Ninja](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#pto-ninja), select a role as your backup during your PTO. Please assign the team slack channel #g_utilization as your backup to help distribute the workload. Consider if your current work in progress requires a substitute DRI and assign a single person for those specific issues.

1. Add the Fulfillment Shared Calendar to your PTO Ninja settings so your PTO events are visible to everyone in the team. The calendar ID is: `gitlab.com_7199q584haas4tgeuk9qnd48nc@group.calendar.google.com` Read more about [PTO](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off) in the handbook.

1. Update your GitLab.com status with your out of office dates by clicking on your profile picture and selecting "Edit Status." For Example: `OOO Back on yyyy-mm-dd` Adding `OOO` to your status message will keep you from appearing in the [reviewer roulette](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#reviewer-roulette).

## Exception Triage

### Potential list of places to check

The following lists are links to Sentry and other tools where we proactively triage exception reports. 

**CustomersDot:**

1. `UpdateGitlabPlanInfoWorker` errors (syncing between CD -> GL) - [Sentry link](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+UpdateGitlabPlanInfoWorker)

**GitLab:**

1. Subscription related errors - [Sentry link](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+subscription) - could be further filtered by `SubscriptionsController` maybe?
1. Billing related errors - [Sentry link](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+billing) - again, could be further narrowed down to the various `BillingsController`? (`Groups::`, `Projects::`)
1. Utilization feature category logs over the last 7 days - [Rails Kibana link](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/c97cd8d278b9cae18c8588c85a82a2d6) , [Sidekiq Kibana link](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7fe39288bc23a368ddbec6ed369c3ab2)
1. Billable Member API endpoints - [Grafana dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/api-rails-controller/api-rails-controller?orgId=1)
