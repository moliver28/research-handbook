## Vision

The InfraDev team initiative is part of our FY22-Q2 OKR to [implement at least 1 reliability improvement each month](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/11396).

The team is formed of [volunteers from any of the Fulfillment teams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/206) that dedicate a small percentage of the time to the initiative.

### 2021 Roadmap

| Work | Guesstimate | Status | Theme |
| ---  | ---         | ---    | ---   |
| Create a new Google Cloud Project for staging  | M  | Done | Infrastructure Setup |
| Use Puma as default web server | L | WIP, Q2 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Configure basic Ansible playbook | L | WIP, Q2 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Configure Ansible CustomersDot environment | M | WIP, Q2 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Deploy to staging using Ansible | L | Q2-Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Configure Ansible CustomersDot deployment | L | Q2-Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Add CustomersDot deployment to GitLab CI | L | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Configure fail2ban, cloudfare | L | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Create a new Google Cloud Project for production | L | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Replicate current deployment blocking (auto-block on staging failure) | L | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Migrate to new production fleet and testing | XXL | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Clean up old customers Infra | M | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Static IP address requirements | L | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Use Ansible/Ansistrano auto-rollback feature | L | Q3 | Infrastructure Setup |
| Add Prometheus monitoring | M | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| Add minimum uptime/health checks and alerts | L | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| Add logs to Kibana | L | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| Add current API health and alerts (including Zuora, SFDC...) | L | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| Configure all alerts with Slack notifications | M | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| Define SLA and make dashboards for CustomersDot | L | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| Configure deployment notifications and alerts | L | Q3 | Basic Observability |
| HA Environment in production and deployment | XL | Q4 | Redundancy |
| Add Cloud Licensing observability and alerts | XL | Q4 | Advanced Observability |
| Add more Prometheus metrics | L | Q4 | Advanced Observability |
| Add business metrics and alerts | XL | Q4 | Advanced Observability |

**Rough guesstimate:**
M = 0.25 milestone, 1 person
L = 0.5 milestone, 1 person
XL = 1 milestone, 1 person
XXL = 2 milestones, 1 person

Q2 = M x 2 + L x 2 = 0.25 x 2 + 0.5 x 2 = 1.5 milestones, 1 person
Q3 = M x 3 + L x 13 + XXL x 1 = 0.25 x 3 + 0.5 x 13 + 2 = 9.25 milestones, 1 person
Q4 = L x 1 + XL x 3 = 0.5 x 1 + 1 x 3 = 3.5 milestones, 1 person

## How we work

### Monthly engineer registration

Once the volunteers have been given approvals in the [relevant issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/206), they should book the times or days they'll be working on the initiative for the current/next month, ideally beforehand.

1. Book the day using your name as a new event in the [Fulfillment InfraDev calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=Y19yYjIzYXRtbzhkaTMwMTdsdGtob2M2ZWdkMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
1. Ping your manager to check the time you are going to spend on the initiative and dates are OK
1. Keep the calendar updated

### Picking and working on issues

Given the small percentage of time dedicated by each engineer, the workflow is a bit different to that of GitLab in order to be more efficient. Therefore, engineers can pick any unassigned issue that is not blocked.

1. Use the [Fulfillment InfraDev Kanban board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/2710654?&label_name[]=Fulfillment%3A%3AInfraDev)
1. Pick an issue from the top that is unassigned and either `ready for development` or `in dev` or `in review`
1. At the end of your shift/day please either close the issue if done, or leave an update for the next engineer and unassign yourself from the issue. If you are working on it on consecutive days, you can keep yourself assigned. The following template can be used:

```
## Async issue update
1. Please provide a summary of the current status and blockers
1. What would be the focus for the next engineer that picks this issue?

/unassign @yourhandlehere
```

## Reaching out for help

We have a Slack channel to discuss the initiative and for the team to get help with blockers - `#s_fulfillment_infradev`

## How do we know if we succeeded?

We will track the OKR to [implement at least 1 reliability improvement each month](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/11396)

## Monthly retrospective

Every month we'll do a retrospective to see how things are working out and find any areas of improvement
