## Overview

Department Senior Managers and above, and the aligned People Business Partner [review projected promotions every quarter](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration). For individual contributor (IC) promotions, we manage and track the **review process** using GitLab issues in this [project available to senior managers and above](https://gitlab.com/development-dept-topics/promotion-demo/-/boards/3853857) and Google sheets. 

A GitLab Issue is created for each IC promotion using the issue template including associateed tracking lables.

## Each quarter

1. Engineering senior managers and above create issues and associated promotion documents for their team in this [project](https://gitlab.com/development-dept-topics/promotion-demo/-/boards/3853857)
1. Engineering senior managers and above manage the process using the issues (and associated issue template)
1. VP of development and aligned People Business Partner use issue boards, associated issues (and promotion docs that they link to) to review the promotion documents.
1. The promotion document review is followed by the [Calibration process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration), for which we will (continue to) use Google sheets to guide discussion and track approvals.
