## Overview

Department Leadership and the aligned People Business Partner [review projected promotions every quarter](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration). We plan to manage and track the **review process** using GitLab issues in this [project available to people managers](https://gitlab.com/development-dept-topics/promotion-demo/-/boards/3853857) and Google sheets. 

A GitLab Issue is created for each promotion under review that includes the following:

## Issue template example

```
Link to Promotion Document: TBD

 (All comments made on the promotion document itself will be managed inside the Google doc)

- [ ] EM creates promotion document in google drive using the promotion document template
- [ ] EM determines which quarter they would like to target the promotion for and add the appropriate label
- [ ] EM has confirmed that the promotion document [meets the required criteria](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#creating-a-promotion-or-compensation-change-document)
- [ ] EM asks peer on the team to review the promotion doc.  
- [ ] Director or above approved

## Each quarter

1. Engineering managers and above create issues and associated promotion documents for their team in this [project](https://gitlab.com/development-dept-topics/promotion-demo/-/boards/3853857)
1. Engineering managers manage the process using the issues (and associated issue template)
1. VP of development and aligned People Business Partner use issue boards, associated issues (and promotion docs that they link to) to review the promotion documents.
1. The promotion document review is followed by the [Calibration process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration), for which we will (continue to) use Google sheets to guide discussion and track approvals.
