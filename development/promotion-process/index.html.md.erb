## Overview

Department Senior Managers and above, and the aligned People Business Partner [review projected promotions every quarter](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration). For individual contributor (IC) promotions, we manage and track the **review process** using GitLab issues in this [project available to senior managers and above](https://gitlab.com/development-dept-topics/promotion-demo/-/boards/3853857) and Google sheets. 

A GitLab Issue is created for each IC promotion using the issue template including associateed tracking lables.

## Each quarter

1. Engineering senior managers and above create issues and associated promotion documents for their team in this [project](https://gitlab.com/development-dept-topics/promotion-demo/-/boards/3853857)
1. Engineering senior managers and above manage the process using the issues (and associated issue template)
1. VP of development and aligned People Business Partner use issue boards, associated issues (and promotion docs that they link to) to review the promotion documents.
1. The promotion document review is followed by the [Calibration process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration), for which we will (continue to) use Google sheets to guide discussion and track approvals.


## Example issue template

In the interest of transparency an example of the issue template is below (although the SSOT is the issue template in the private project):

```
# Purpose

In this issue, we collect information needed for the Promotion Process and track our progress. This issue and process are used for **individual contributor promotions only**.

# Required Tasks 

- [ ] EM creates promotion document in google drive using the [promotion document template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDkYGK2yhe8pD-lnMGmEF-Cf0IlGgVOznjXMq9FxGiQ/edit).  SEM+ links to this issue.
- [ ] EM determines which quarter they would like to target the promotion for and add the appropriate label.  SEM+ udpates this issue accordingly.
- [ ] SEM+ sets the scoped labels for `FY` (fiscal year such as 23),  quarter (such as Q1), `devops` (devops stage such as create), `director` (director name such as Tim Z), `SrMgr` (senior manager name such as Darva S), `Current` (current level such as intermediate) and `Future` (future level such as senior), 'role' such as 'Backend / Frontend / Fullstack'.  This enables the issues to be filtered and viewed in the appropriate boards.
- [ ] SEM+ has confirmed that the promotion document [meets the required criteria](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#creating-a-promotion-or-compensation-change-document)
- [ ] SEM+ has confirmed that the promotion document is <=3 pages
- [ ] SEM+ asks other SEM+ on the team to review the promotion document 
- [ ] SEM+ asks Director/Senior Engineering Manager who reports to the VP of Development review 
- [ ] Direct report of the VP of Development has approved

# How to use this issue

**Assignees**

* The assignee changes depending on who is responsible for taking the next action in the workflow

**Author**

* Practice good label hygiene 
    * There are many issue boards derived from the labels and will be inaccurate if good label hygiene is not practiced.
