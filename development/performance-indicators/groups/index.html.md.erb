## Troubleshooting

Group information comes from the `job title specialty` field in Bamboo HR. Per the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#job-information-change-in-bamboohr), managers are responsible for updating the `job title speciality` field in for any/all specialty changes.

* If you detect that the group information is incorrect for a team member during a specific time frame, please open a [data team issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) and describe the current and correct team member’s group information. In your request, please include the `employee id`, `division`, `department`, `job title speciality`, `effective date`, and `end date`.
    - For team members with more than one group, please list all groups separated by a comma.
* If a team member isn’t counted in the organization metrics but their group information is correct in Bamboo HR, check that the [email in their GitLab.com profile](https://gitlab.com/profile/notifications) matches the work email in Bamboo HR. If there is a mismatch, update the Bamboo HR profile email to match the GitLab.com notification email.
