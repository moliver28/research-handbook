      1. Terraform State Backend
      1. Terraform Plan summary in MRs
      1. Rolled out a GitLab Metric Dashboard as GitLab.com's new official SLA dashboard
      1. Shipped variables in Metric Dashboards and a bunch of other dashboard improvements
      1. Brought Alert Management from planned to minimal in one milestone
      1. Multiple Status Page improvements, such as the /publish feature
1. A [significant increase in MRs](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/533956/Development-Department-and-Sub-department-MR-Metrics?widget=7009931&udv=0).  We merged 405 MRs, a 38% increase over the previous all time high of 292!

These are impressive results and we will take a moment to celebrate everyone's hard work contributing to them.

Members of the Ops Sub-department and their stable counterparts can expense up to $25 in the month of June for pizza (or food items of your choice).  We will also hold several Pizza Party meetings where team members can (optionally) enjoy their pizza with their colleagues and a slack channel where team members can (optionally) share photos of themselves celebrating.  Expenses must be incurred in the month of June 2020 and should be submitted through the normal expense process, with a description of June 2020 Ops Sub-department Virtual Pizza Party.
