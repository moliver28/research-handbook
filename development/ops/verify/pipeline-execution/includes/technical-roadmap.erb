### FY24

These are our high-level engineering driven goals for the year. As with any of our goals, they are ambitious and subject to change.

#### Performance
##### Pipeline Speed
**Goals:**
   - Understand what we can do to improve pipeline speed
   - Prototype at least one big swing improvement

##### Pipeline Scheduling Algorithm / Queuing
**Goals:**
   - Settle on path forward for what changes we want to make to the algorithm
   - Complete phase 1 implementation based on decisions

#### Scalability
##### CI Database Partitioning

**Goals:**
  - Complete the data partitioning of the 6 largest CI tables - [Blueprint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/ci_data_decay/pipeline_partitioning.html)

##### Reduce Operating costs

**Goals:**
  - Identify potential cost savings from compressing job logs - [Spike](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390114)
     - Depending on results, schedule work to implement compression.

#### Developer Efficiency
##### Frontend Refactoring to Vue

**Goals:**
  - Complete the refactoring of the schedules pages to Vue
  - Complete the refactoring of the pipeline triggers pages to Vue
  - Complete the refactoring of the pipeline subscriptions pages to Vue

##### Support Internal Pipeline Dogfooding

**Goals:**
  - Contribute to [Dogfooding Audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/team/-/issues/206)
     - Schedule issues that arise as a result of the audit

##### Merge Trains
**Goals:**
  - Get merge trains to a state where they are scalable enough to be used effectively by the GitLab project.
