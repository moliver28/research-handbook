## Overview
The goal of this page is to create, share and iterate the Risk Map for the Continuous Integration team.
### Goals
Utilise the Risk Map as a tool to:
- Understand the risks the team faces
- Increase transparency on mitigation plans
- Effectively allocate limited resources
- Collaborate strategically in improving Quality
### General Risk Map
#### Map key
* Impact - what happens if the risk is not mitigated or eliminated
* Impact level - Rate 1 (LOW) to 5 (HIGH)
* Probability - Rate 1 (LOW) to 5 (HIGH)
* Priority - Impact x Probability. Address highest score first.
* Mitigation - what could be done to lower the impact or probability
