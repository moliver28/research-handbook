## Vision
We provide confidence in software through the delivery of meaningful, actionable automated testing results in GitLab.

## Mission
The Verify:Testing Group provides automated testing integration into GitLab. We aim to allow software teams to be able to easily integrate many layers of testing into their GitLab CI workflow including:

* [Code Quality](/direction/verify/code_quality/)
* [Code Testing & Coverage](/direction/verify/code_testing/)
* [Load Testing](/direction/verify/load_testing/)
* [Web Performance](/direction/verify/web_performance/)
* [Usability Testing](/direction/verify/usability_testing/)
* [Accessibility Testing](/direction/verify/accessibility_testing/)

See all current and planned category maturity in the [Maturity page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/#verify).

We want software teams to feel confident that the changes they introduce into their code are safe and conformant. 

## Performance Indicators
We measure the value we contribute by using a [Product Performance Indicator](/handbook/product/metrics/). Our current PI for the Testing group is the [Paid GMAU](/handbook/product/ops-section-performance-indicators/#verifytesting---paid-gmau---count-of-active-paid-testing-feature-users). This is a rolling count of unique users who have interacted with any paid Testing feature. We count only users interacting with Paid Features, as opposed to users on paid plans using any feature, because our team goal is to drive additional value in the Premium and Ultimate tiers within the Verify Stage. We are tracking progress of this in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2991).

### Adoption Funnel
This funnel represents the customer journey and the various means a product manager may apply a Performance Indicator metric to drive a desired behavior in the funnel. This framework can be applied to any of the categories being worked on by Verify:Testing. The current priority is to increase Activation, Retention and Revenue within the [Code Testing and Coverage](/direction/verify/code_testing/) Category.

## How we work

### Planning

#### Quad-planning
Also known as the [Three Amigos](ttps://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-amigos) process, Quad-planning is the development of a shared understanding about the scope of work in an issue and what it means for the work represented in an issue to be considered done. When an SET counterpart is assigned, we will perform Quad-planning earlier in the planning process than described in the [product workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan), beginning when the PM develops initial acceptance criteria. Once this occurs, the PM will apply the `quad-planning:ready` label. At this point, asynchronous collaboration will begin between product, engineering, UX, and quality. Supplying these distinct viewpoints at this early stage of planning is valuable to our team. This can take place more than one milestone into the future. Once acceptance criteria is agreed upon, the `quad-planning:complete` label is applied.

#### Release planning issue
We use a [release planning issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/testing-group/-/issues/new?issuable_template=ReleasePlan) to plan our release-level priorities over each milestone. This issue is used to highlight deliverables, capacity, team member holidays, and more. This allows team members and managers to see at a high-level what we are planning on accomplishing for each release, and serves as a central location for collecting information.

#### Issue weighting and refinement
Before issues can be moved from the Planning Breakdown stage into the Ready for Development stage, they must have a weight applied. We use [this table](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create-source-code-be/#weights) to decide what weight an issue should have. We follow an asynchronous refinement process in lieu of a synchronous refinement meeting. This helps us be more Inclusive and work more asynchronously. Engineers should take time each week to review the issues that are in [Planning Breakdown](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Atesting&label_name%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Aplanning+breakdown&scope=all&sort=milestone&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93) for the next milestone and see what they can do to better refine and weight those issues.

#### Design issues and SSOT
There may be times in which an issue requires a new design proposal. When those issues are also labeled as `~direction` items we create a separate design issue for them for the Product Designer to work through. The reason for this is to be as accurate as possible in displaying on the [Upcoming Releases page](https://about.gitlab.com/upcoming-releases/) when the feature will be implemented.

When a separate design issue is created, we label it `[~UX](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?label_name[]=UX)` and `[~workflow:design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?label_name[]=workflow%3A%3Adesign)`. The issue is titled `Design: [feature description]`. [See example issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293730). Engineers, Product Manager, and Product Designer will refine design issues by providing guidance and facilitating design discussions before issues are ready for development.

Once the design issue is ready for development, Product Manager and Product Designer will close the issue and cross-link it in the implementation issue (and repeat this in the design issue the other way).

#### Technical Investigation
In the process of refinement we may discover a new feature will require a [blueprint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/blob/master/doc/workflow.md) or the team feels input from maintainers will help scope down the problem, ensure the feature is performant and/or reduce future technical debt. When this happens the team will create a Technical Investigation issue for the investigation. This issue will be assigned to one team member. That team member should spend the minimum amount of time to create documentation, a [poc](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/release/poc.html), or some other artifact that clarifies the approach to the problem, ideally in less than 5 working days. This will help us to gather information, validate the solution with others, and propose a plan to execute. They will answer specific questions outlined in the Technical Investigation issue before work on the feature is started. This process is analogous to the concept of a [Spike](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/monitor/#spike).

#### Release post checklist issue
During each milestone, we create a [Release Post Checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/testing-group/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Release-Post-Issue) issue that is used by team members to help track the progress of the team [release posts](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/). We use the checklist issue to associate release post merge requests with links to the implementation issue, links to updated documentation, and list which engineers are working on each issue. The checklist issue provides a single place to see all this information.

#### Deliverables in a Milestone
Engineering managers apply the `Deliverable` label on issues that meet the following criteria:

* It is delivering value that is visible to the user
* It is near the top of the issue board (high priority)
* The issue is well-defined
* UX DoD is applied 
* The issue is weighted
* The engineering manager believes we have the capacity to complete the work in the assigned milestone
* The team has accepted the issue into the milestone and moved it to ~"workflow::ready for development" status

We will use the `Stretch` label if we feel the issue meets most of the criteria but either contains some known unknowns, or it's uncertain whether we will have the capacity to complete the work in the current milestone. If an issue with a `Stretch` label is carried over into the next milestone, its label will change to `Deliverable`. The position in the issue board is what confers priority, rather than the presence of a `Deliverable` label. However most high priority issues are `Deliverable`.

There may be some issues in a milestone with neither `Deliverable` nor `Stretch` labels but will strive to have the majority of issues labeled with one of these.

#### Definition of Ready
Before the team will accept an issue into a milestone for work it must meet these criteria:

* Issues labeled with ~feature include a well stated "why" and customer problem
* Issues labeled ~bug include steps to reproduce
* Designs are in the design tab if needed
* If the issue will be worked on by Verify:Testing engineers, it has a [weight](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create-source-code-be/#weights)
* Design proposal satisfies the [UX Definition of Done (DoD)](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/#definition-of-done-for-ux-pilot)

#### Definition of Blocked
Issues that depend on another issue to be completed before they can be validated on `Canary` are considered blocked, and should have the `~workflow::blocked` label applied. The issues should also be marked as blocked within the [related issues section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html#adding-a-related-issue) of the issues.

#### Prioritizing technical debt
We follow the [company guidance](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#prioritizing-technical-decisions) in how we prioritize technical debt. In order to manage this effectively we have decided to keep track of technical debt and feature maintenance issues that are ready to be worked on in the "~workflow::scheduling" column, prioritized by Product, but informed by the impact these issues will have on our future velocity. We will try to dedicate a certain percentage (~20%) of our capacity by weight in each milestone to paying down technical debt. We do not consider bugs to be technical debt, and they are prioritized as part of the remaining 80% of capacity by weight.

#### Follow-up Issues
We utilize a process wherein issues that are follow-ups to other issues and are being worked on in the same milestone they are created will have a `~follow-up` label added to them. Examples of items the team may create and label as `~follow-up` include but is not limited to feature scope-creep, non-blocking requests from code review, additional UI polish, non-blocking refactoring that can be done, Low Priority (P2 or lower) bug fixes, etc.

### Workflow
Unless specifically mentioned below, the Verify:Testing group follows the standard [engineering](/handbook/engineering/workflow/) and [product](/handbook/product-development-flow/) workflows.

#### Starting New Work
Verify:Testing team members are encouraged to start looking for work starting **_Right to left_** in the milestone board. This is also known as _"Pulling from the right"_. If there is an issue that a team member can help along on the board, they should do so instead of starting new work. This includes conducting code review on issues that the team member may not be assigned to if they feel that they can add value and help move the issue along the board.

Specifically this means, in order:
* Doing verification that code has made it to staging, canary, or production
* Conducting code reviews on issues that are `workflow::in review`
* Unblocking anyone in the `workflow::in development` column
* Then, finally, picking from the top of the `workflow::ready for development` column OR an item the team member investigated to apply the estimated weight if unfamiliar with the top item

The goal with this process is to reduce WIP. Reducing WIP forces us to "Start less, finish more", and it also reduces cycle time. Engineers should keep in mind that the DRI for a merge request is the **author(s)**, just because we are putting emphasis on the importance of teamwork does not mean we should dilute the fact that having a [DRI is encouraged by our values](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dris-and-our-values).

##### Priority
Issues in "Planning Breakdown" and "Ready for Development" are in top-to-bottom priority order on the [planning board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/364216?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Atesting&milestone_title=%23started). Issues further to the right on the issue board are not in vertical priority order. Rather, the further to the right an issue is on the board, the higher the priority which follows our [_"Pull from the right"_](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/testing/#starting-new-work) philosophy of working.

When the end of a milestone is getting close and/or there is no work a team member can take on within the milestone they should use their best judgement in starting an issue at the top of the `~workflow::ready for development` column of the next milestone OR starting an issue with the [`~workflow::scheduling` label](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Atesting&label_name[]=workflow%3A%3Ascheduling). 

#### Code Review
Code reviews follow the standard process of using the reviewer roulette to choose a reviewer and a maintainer. The roulette is **optional**, so if a merge request contains changes that someone outside our group may not fully understand in depth, it is encouraged that a member of the Verify:Testing team be chosen for the preliminary review to focus on correctly solving the problem. The intent is to leave this choice to the discretion of the engineer but raise the idea that fellow Verify:Testing team members will sometimes be best able to understand the implications of the features we are implementing. The maintainer review will then be more focused on quality and code standards.

We also recommend that team members take some time to review each others merge requests even if they are not assigned to do so, as described in the [GitLab code review process](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#reviewer). It is not necessary to assign anyone except the initial domain reviewer to your Merge Request. This process augmentation is intended to encourage team members to review Merge Requests that they are not assigned to. As a new team, reviewing each others merge requests allows us to build familiarity with our product area, helps reduce the amount of investigation that needs to be done when implementing features and fixes, and increases our [lottery factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). The more review we can do ourselves, the less work the maintainer will have to do to get the merge request into good shape.

This tactic also creates an environment to ask for early review on a WIP merge request where the solution might be better refined through collaboration and also allows us to share knowledge across the team.

#### Issue Health Status Definitions:
- **On Track** - We are confident this issue will be completed and live for the current milestone. It is all [downhill from here](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-12#work-is-like-a-hill).
- **Needs Attention** - There are concerns, new complexity, or unanswered questions that if left unattended will result in the issue missing its targeted release. Collaboration needed to get back `On Track` within the week.
   - If you are moving an item into this status please mention individuals in the issue you believe can help out in order to unstick the item so that it can get back to an `On Track` status.
- **At Risk** - The issue in its current state will not make the planned release and immediate action is needed to get it back to `On Track` today.
  - If you are moving an item into this status please consider posting in the [https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CPANF553J](#g_testing) channel in slack. Try to include anything that can be done to unstick the item so that it can get back to an `On Track` status in your message.
  - Note: It is possible that there is nothing to be done that can get the item back on track in the current milestone. If that is the case please let your manager know as soon as you are aware of this.

#### Issue progress updates
When an engineer is actively working (workflow of ~workflow::"In dev" or further right on current milestone) on an issue they will periodically leave status updates as top-level comments in the issue. The status comment should include the updated health status, any blockers, notes on what was done, if review has started, and anything else the engineer feels is beneficial. If there are multiple people working on it also include whether this is a front end or back end update. An update for each of MR associated with the issue should be included in the update comment. Engineers should also update the [health status](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/#health-status) of the issue at this time.

This update need not adhere to a particular format. Some ideas for formats:

```text
Health status: (On track|Needs attention|At risk)
Notes: (Share what needs to be shared specially when the issue needs attention or is at risk)
```

```text
Health status: (On track|Needs attention|At risk)
What's left to be done:
What's blocking: (probably empty when on track)
```

```text
## Update <date>
Health status: (On track|Needs attention|At risk)
What's left to be done:

#### MRs
1. !MyMR1
1. !MyMR2
1. !MyMR3
```

There are several benefits to this approach:

* Team members can better identify what they can do to help the issue move along the board
* Creates an opening for other engineers to engage and collaborate if they have ideas
* Leaving a status update is a good prompt to ask questions and start a discussion
* The wider GitLab community can more easily follow along with product development
* A history of the roadblocks the issue encountered is readily available in case of retrospection
* Product and Engineering managers are more easily able to keep informed of the progress of work

Some notes/suggestions:

* We typically expect engineers to leave at least one status update per week, barring special circumstances
* Ideally status updates are made at a logical part of an engineers workflow, to minimize disruption
* It is not necessary that the updates happen at the same time/day each week
* Generally when there is a logical time to leave an update, that is the best time
* Engineers are encouraged to use these updates as a place to collect some technical notes and thoughts or "think out loud" as they work through an issue

#### Monitoring changes behind feature flags
In addition to the steps documented for [developing with feature flags at GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/) Verify:Testing engineers monitor their changes' impact on infrastructure using dashboards and logs where possible. Because feature flags allow engineers to have complete control over their code in production it also enables them to take ownership of monitoring the impact their changes have against production infrastructure. In order to monitor our changes we use this [helpful selection of dashboards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/monitoring/#selection-of-useful-dashboards-from-the-monitoring) and specifically the [Rails controller dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/web-rails-controller/web-rails-controller) (Internal Only) for monitoring our changes in production. Metrics we evaluate include latency, throughput, CPU usage, memory usage, and database calls, depending on what our change's expected impact will be and any considerations called out in the issue.

The goal of this process is to reduce the time that a change could potentially have an impact on production infrastructure to the smallest possible window. A side benefit of this process is to increase engineer familiarity with our monitoring tools, and develop more experience with predicting the outcomes of changes as they relate to infrastructure metrics.

#### Closing Issues
After an engineer has ensured that the [Definition of Done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done) is met for an issue, they are the ones responsible for closing it. The engineer responsible for verifying an issue is done is the engineer who is the DRI for that issue, or the DRI for the final merge request that completes the work on an issue.

#### Issues for community contributions
We want to create a welcoming environment for everyone who is interested in contributing to GitLab in anyway be it code, documentation, UX, or others.

If an issue is being resolved in a merge request that is made by a [community contributor](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/), the engineering manager will assign the associated issue to themselves to keep better track of it. The engineering manager will help to coach the community contributor through the merge request process, or be responsible for delegating that coaching to a team member engineer.

### Meeting
We meet on a weekly cadence for one synchronous meeting.

#### Testing Group Weekly Meeting
This synchronous meeting is to discuss anything that is blocking, or notable from the past week. This meeting acts as a team touchpoint.

#### Async Daily Standups
We use [geekbot](https://geekbot.com/) integrated with Slack for our daily async standup. The purpose of the daily standup meeting is to keep the team informed about what everyone is working on, and to surface blockers so we can eliminate them. The standup bot will run at 10am in the team members local time and ask 2 questions:
1. What will you do today?
1. Anything blocking your progress?

#### Async Monthly Retrospectives
We use a GitLab issue in [this project](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/verify-stage/testing/-/issues/) for our monthly retrospective. The issue is created automatically towards the end of the current milestone. The purpose of the monthly retrospective issue is to reflect on the milestone and talk about what went well, what didn't go so well, and what we can do better.

#### Think BIG / Think small
We have a monthly synchronous 30-minute [think big meeting](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/thinkbig/), followed the next week by a monthly 30-minute think small meeting on the same topic of the previous think big meeting. This pair of meetings is modeled after the Gitlab Product Manager [deep dive interview](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/hiring-processes/blob/master/Product/DeepDive.md). The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the vision, product roadmap, user research, design, and delivery around the Testing features. The goal of this meeting will be to align the team on our medium to long-term goals and ensure that our short-term goals are leading us in that direction. This meeting is useful for aligning the team with its stable counterparts and ensuring that engineers have an understanding of the big picture and so they know how their work fits into the long-term goals of the team.

## How to work with us

### On issues
Issues worked on by the testing group have a group label of ~"group::testing". Issues that contribute to the verify stage of the devops toolchain have the ~"devops::verify" label.
