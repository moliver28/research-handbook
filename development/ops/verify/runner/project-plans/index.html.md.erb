## Dedicated SaaS Runners for GitLab Dedicated

**Runner Team DRI:** Joseph Burnett
**Slack Channel:** #f_hosted_runners

**Description:** A dedicated runner is a runner that would only be registered to a specific project, group, or instance and not be shared with other users.
With this project GitLab will spin up dedicated runner resources within the Dedicated cloud account.
The project plan tracking this work can be [found here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/shared-runners/infrastructure/-/issues/158).

### Iteration 16.5 (ending 2023-10-19)

- [ ] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/runner-tools/grit/-/issues/14+s
- [ ] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/shared-runners/infrastructure/-/issues/87+s

### Week of 2023-09-25

- [X] Verify Runner SaaS delivery timeline meets the requirements of Environment Automation.
  It does: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/2825#note_1586596202

### Week of 2023-10-02

#### Goals:

- [X] Consolidate all work under a single sub-epic. 
  Update issue and epic structure to reflect our agreement to deliver infrastructure-as-a-library (GRIT) and for Environment Automation to operate the runners themselves.

### Week of 2023-10-09

Clarified epic and issue structure with Dedicated ([thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/2825#note_1586917812)).
New project plan for Runner side to replace previous epic: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/shared-runners/infrastructure/-/issues/158
New GRIT sub-epic to track all library work for this use-case: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/ci-cd/runner-tools/-/epics/2 

#### Goals:

- [ ] Create a provisional Docker capable Linux AMI
- [ ] Update [`dev` environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/runner-tools/grit/-/blob/master/modules/dev/dev.tf) to support Linux.
