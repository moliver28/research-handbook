Welcome to the team! Whether you're joining GitLab as a new hire, transferring internally or ramping up on the CI domain knowledge to tackle issues in our area, you'll be assigned an [onboarding/shadowing buddy](/handbook/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/) so you can have someone to work with as you're getting familiarized with our codebase, our tech stack and general development processes on CI.

Read over this page as a starting point, and feel free to set up regular sync or async conversations with your buddy. We recommend setting up weekly touch points at a minimum, and joining our regular team syncs to learn more about how we work. (Reach out to our Engineering Managers for an invite to those recurring meetings). You're also welcome to schedule a few coffee chats to meet some members of our team. There is also a [CI Developer onboarding checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/onboarding/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/verify-ci_developer-onboarding.md) for you to go through if it's helpful, which will have admin tasks to complete (as a new team member, if relevant), and also links to technical documentation, meeting agendas and recordings.

Issues labelled with `~onboarding` are smaller issues to help you get onboarded into the CI feature area. We typically work Kanban, so if there aren't [any `~onboarding` issues in the current milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1372896?milestone_title=%23started&label_name[]=onboarding), reach out to your EM/PM to see which issues you can start on as part of your onboarding period.

In May 2021, we introduced the [CI Shadow Program](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2542), which we are trialing as a way to onboard existing GitLab team members from other Engineering teams to the CI domain and contribute to CI features.
