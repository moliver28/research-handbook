If an issue has several components (e.g. ~frontend, ~backend, or ~documentation) it may be useful to split it up into separate implementation issues.
The original issue should hold all the discussion around the feature, with the implementation issues being used to track the work done.
Doing this provides several benefits:

1. There's only one DRI per issue.
1. Workflow labels and health statuses are more relevant.
1. We can weight issues with more accuracy.
1. We can mark one implementation as a blocker for another.
1. It's easier to see what work can be picked up by each functional group.
1. We can schedule feature work across multiple milestones.

When creating implementation issues, we need to link the implementation issue to the original feature issue.
You should be able to see from the feature issue that it depends on implementation issues, and what the status of those issues are.
It will be the responsibility of the engineering and product managers to keep these issues readable and make sure everything links back to the original feature issue.

Please use implementation issues responsibly.
They make sense for larger issues, but can be cumbersome for smaller features.

**Note:** This workflow is being tested through FY22-Q1 and we will host a [retrospective](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/pipeline-authoring/-/issues/9) at the end of the quarter to measure its effectiveness.
