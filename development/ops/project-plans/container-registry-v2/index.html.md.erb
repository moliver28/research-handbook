## Weekly Project Plan

Epic: [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5521](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5521)

### Milestone 16.3 (June 18, 2023 - July 17, 2023)

#### Goals:
- Building instructions for manual install of the metadata database
- Planning discussions on how to breakdown the project into Experimental and Beta phases
- Milestone plan: [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416110#container-registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416110#container-registry)

#### Week of Aug 14-18
- Completed: 
    - Updated the [architecture blueprint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/container_registry_metadata_database_self_managed_rollout/) with a new table structured for our feature based rollout approach: [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128824](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128824)
    - Completed the POC for installing the database using Helm and Omnibus for new installations.  Demo videos are posted in the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1065) for both installation paths.
    - Implemented Headway automation. All issues and MRs marked with the `~headway-self-managed-registry-db label` will be added to tables in the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5521).
    - Product is researching how GitLab has structured communication with users in other beta programs through the use of separate issues for enrollment and feedback.  This also provides a communication channel for users who reach out to us through our Support counterpart.

### Milestone 16.4 (August 18, 2023 - September 17, 2023)

#### Goals:

- Weekly forecasts for this project will be determined over the course of this milestone.  This project is just getting started and will initially be reactive to research findings and user feedback.

#### Week of Aug 21-26
- Plan:
  - Define the features and draft changes for the feature based rollout approach discussed last week.  This matrix of features will be documented in the [architecture blueprint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/container_registry_metadata_database_self_managed_rollout/).

- Completed:
  - Created issues for communication with users regarding [beta interest](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/379240) and [feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/423459).  Discussions are in progress with a potential first user for the beta program.
  - Through testing, the team discovered a problem with persisting database configuration which will need to be fixed in 16.4 before the beta user can start the installation. 

#### Week of Sept 4-8
- Plan:
  - Review and merge the omnibus [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/7100) for persisting database settings.
