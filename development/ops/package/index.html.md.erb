## Package Group

The Package group works on the part of GitLab concerning the [Package
stage], which integrates with [GitLab's CI/CD product](/direction/ops/).
Our mission is to create a secure environment where both source code and dependencies can live by
allowing you to publish, consume, and discover packages of a large variety of languages and platforms
all in one place.
The package group is a [Fullstack team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#fullstack-teams) which means that all the engineers, Frontend and Backend, report to a single [Fullstack Engineering Manager](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/development/management/fullstack-manager/). The intention of using this model is to increase efficiency and drive results by building a process that supports all team members towards our goals. Primarily, this means that all engineers participate in conversations in the group and contribute broadly to group process iteration.

The package group is made up of 3 functional teams:
- Two Go engineers primarily responsible for
  - [Container Registry](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#container-registry/)
  - [Helm Chart Registry](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#helm-chart-registry)
- Three Ruby engineers who are primarily responsible for:
  - [Package Registry](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#package-registry)
  - [Dependency Proxy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#dependency-proxy)
  - [Dependency Firewall](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#dependency-firewall)
  - [Git LFS](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#git-lfs)
- One frontend engineer who is primarily responsible for
  - Implementation of User Experience spanning all categories

Due to these small functional teams, the Package group deliverables are sometimes more at risk given that there are fewer people who can help out.

For more details about the vision for this area of the product, see the [product vision] page.

### Reliability and Infradev focus

During FY22-Q3 GitLab in general, the Ops Sub-department, and the Package Group are focused on reliability issues with a particular focus on infradev issues. Infradev issues are issues that have been escalated by our infrastructure as items to address and have their own SLOs associated with them.

You can view the Package Group's board for infradev issues we're targeting during FY22-Q3 [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/boards/3143028?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apackage&label_name[]=infradev)

| Milestone | issue(s) | 
| :-------- | :---- |
| %14.3     | [Investigation: Consider caching the list of tags for container repositories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327311) |
|           | [Remove subtransactions from `Packages::Package` model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338947) |
|           | [Remove subtransactions from `Packages::Composer::CacheFile` model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338953) |
|           | [Remove subtransactions from `Packages::BuildInfo` model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338954) |
| %14.4     | [Dependency Proxy workhorse migration implementation plan (rails)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335560) |
|           | [When Container Registry is unavailable, the UI of GitLab shows incorrect information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227466) |
| %14.5     | [Properly reply when "go get" gets a user that needs a 2factor authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292732) |
|           | [GET /api/:version/groups/:id/registry/repositories has poor performance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329637) |

The second issue scheduled for %14.5 [GET /api/:version/groups/:id/registry/repositories has poor performance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329637) is a breaking API change and likely won't be delivered until %15.0.

### Performance indicators

We measure the value we contribute by using [performance indicator metrics](/handbook/product/ops-section-performance-indicators/). The primary metric used for the Package group is the number of monthly active users or GMAU. For more details, please check out the [Ops section's performance indicators](/handbook/product/ops-section-performance-indicators/).

#### Dashboards

We monitor our features using different dashboards. It is recommended to check them weekly.

These dashboards are all internal and can be only accessed by GitLab Team members.

- [Package Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-package/stage-groups-group-dashboard-package-package) (Grafana)

- [Package customer adoption](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/877343/Package-customer-adoption) (SiSense)

#### Error Budget

The Package Group uses the [Error Budget dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-package/stage-groups-group-dashboard-package-package?orgId=1) to measure our budget usage on a weekly basis. The [Package::Package error budget peformance indicator](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ops-section-performance-indicators/#packagepackage---error-budget-for-gitlabcom) is tracked and updated weekly.

#### Usage Funnels

We expect to track the journey of users through the following funnel. You can view the below metrics in the [Package usage funnel dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/854785/Package-Usage-Funnel).

### Think BIG planning
The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the vision, product roadmap, user research, design, and delivery around the Package solution.

#### Goal
The goal of this meeting will be to align the team on our medium to long-term goals and ensure that our short-term goals are leading us in that direction.

#### How it works
We have a ThinkBIG meeting on the second Wednesday of the month at 1:30PM UTC. The agenda document is available per [communication guidelines](/handbook/communication/#scheduling-meetings) and the video of the meeting is shared on our [GitLabUnfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GitLabUnfiltered) to enable asynchronous collaboration. Action items from the meeting will be created with the label `~Package:ThinkBIG`. We evaluate the cadence of the meeting to make sure that it's valuable and in adherance to [meeting guidelines](/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/). For more information on this session, visit the [ThinkBIG handbook page](/handbook/engineering/ux/thinkbig/)

### How we work

#### Roles and responsibilities

Our team emphasises ownership by people who have the information required. This means, for example, in the event of some discussion about UX considerations, our Product Designer will have ownership. When we're building features, the Product Manager owns the decision on whether this is a feature that meets our customer needs. Our Product Developers own the technical solutions being implemented.

#### Understanding our users

As a team, we are committed to understanding our users needs. We believe the best way to do that is by understanding the reason they hired GitLab, and how those motivations translate into our area of the product. For that, we apply a research-driven approach to [Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)](/handbook/engineering/ux/jobs-to-be-done/) framework of innovation. This method aims to understand why a customer uses and buys a given solution. We apply the [job statement](/handbook/engineering/ux/jobs-to-be-done/#how-to-write-jtbd) to identify a list of specific, contextual user needs to fulfill their JTBD.  In addition, we regularly evaluate the overall user experience of each JTBD, with [UX Scorecards](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-scorecards/), to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our users.

##### JTBD

You can view and contribute to our current list of JTBD and job statements [here](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/jtbd).

#### Tips and Tricks

We have created a collection of Tips and Tricks for folks working with/around the Package Stage. You can view them on our [Wiki Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/package-stage/package/-/wikis/Packages-Tips-&-Tricks).

#### Workflow

Our Product Manager owns the problem validation backlog and problem validation process as outlined in the [Product Development Workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/). Our Product Designer then owns the [solution validation](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-3-solution-validation) process. You can view all items and their current state in the [Package: Validation Track](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1397751?&label_name[]=group%3A%3Apackage) issue board.

At the end of this process, the issues will be ready for the [build track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) which is owned by the Product Developers and lives in the [Package:Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1284221?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apackage) issue board.

Once an issue receives the `workflow:scheduling` label, engineers will give the issue a weight, identify any gaps in the description moving the issue eventually to the `workflow:ready for development` state (with the matching label).

Our Product Manager and Engineering Manager will ensure that the `package:active` label is applied to sufficient issues for the team to have work items. Product Developers are empowered to move items into this state as well.

The Product Manager owns the process of populating the current milestone with feature work. This feature work will take priority but, will be limited to 3 to 4 items per milestone. Product Developers are empowered, once feature work has been exhausted, to prioritise customer value issues that will quickly deliver customer value preferring smaller issues over larger ones.

Issues that we're actually expecting to work on will have the `package:active` label added to them at which point they'll appear in the Package:Workflow board. As product developers begin working on the issue, they'll assign the `workflow:in dev` label.

#### Cross-Group Dependencies

Cross-group dependencies may exist as pre-requisites to deliver Package features or bug fixes. Issues to deliver such dependencies are owned by groups that Package depends on, such as [Delivery](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/delivery/) or [Distribution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/distribution/).

For discoverability, issues that represent cross-group dependencies should be labeled with `package:cross-group-dependency`. If working on one of these issues, Package engineers should ensure that they are labeled correctly. For visibility, these issues are shown in the [Package:Cross-Group Assignments](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2470946?label_name[]=package%3Across-group-dependency) issue board.

The product manager should include cross-group dependencies in the milestone planning issue for review, discussion and prioritization.
### Milestone Planning

Our Product Manager, Product Designer, and Engineering Manager develop a plan for upcoming milestones. The issues are labelled and assigned to the milestone. The Product Manager creates an issue for milestone planning that includes the priorities for the milestone. Product Developers review the milestone planning issue, ask questions, raise concerns and weigh each issue. The result of this process is a groomed milestone. Our milestone planning issues can be found in our [Milestone Planning Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3591).

#### Priorities

Throughout the workflow, issues should be addressed in the following priority order:
1. Security issues: These will be at the top of our [Package:Milestones Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1196366?label_name[]=devops%3A%3Apackage&label_name[]=group%3A%3Apackage) and identified with either a `Planning Priority` or `Package::P1` label
1. `Planning Priority` label: Organizational level priorities that span multiple customers and prospects.
1. `Package:P1` label: Used to identify high priority issues that should be committed to in a given milestone or scheduled in an upcoming milestone.
1. `Package:P2` label: Used to identify security issues, bugs and feature requests that although may not be in a milestone, should be worked on ahead of any other work.
1. `Package:Triage` label: Cross-functional dependencies required to resolve important issues for our team.
1. `package:active` label: least effort to largest
1. `workflow::scheduling` label: These are issues that require weighting, feedback and scheduling before being moved to `package:active`

#### Error Budget

[Error Budgets](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/error-budgets/) for stage groups have been established in order to help groups identify and prioritize issues that are impacting customers and infrastructure performance.

The [Error Budget dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-package/stage-groups-group-dashboard-package-package?orgId=1) is used to identify issues that are contributing to the Package group's error budget spend.

The engineering manager will review the error budget dashboard weekly to determine whether we're exceeding our budget, determine what (if anything) is contributing to our error budget spend, and create issues addressing root cause for product manager prioritization. Issues created to address error budget spend should be created using appropriate labels as well as the label `~package::error-budget` in order to facilitate tracking and measurement.

#### Refactoring

When working on an MR for a Deliverable, don't lose track of the aim: release the Deliverable in time. That doesn't mean that refactorings can't happen or that we can't take time to investigate side subjects. It means that we need to limit the time allocated for this type oof work.

When considering a refactoring or a heavy refactoring, consider working [iteratively](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration). A refactoring can be implemented and refined many times but consider releasing a good enough first version so that depending work is not delayed or blocked. For an example of how we can work iteratively, please see [how we worked through lifting the npm naming conventioon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33685#note_512942088).

#### Bug Triaging

##### Investigation

A bug investigation is a two part process:

1. Reproduce the bug locally with the same conditions as described in bug issue.
1. Analyze the possible fix and its complexity.

At the end of this process, the engineer should be able to [weight](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/#issue-weighting) the issue.

The whole process can take a few minutes to several hours (or even days). The assigned engineer should timebox this process to avoid investing too much time in it, without communicating and coordinating with EM and PM, and thus hindering the milestone planning. We suggest that anything that goes above half a day should be coordinated with the team.

If a bug investigation takes more time than intended, it's better to:

- Stop the investigation.
- Post the current situation in the issue.
- Inform the Engineering Manager and the Product Manager that will plan more time for the investigation.

#### Bug detection

When a bug is detected on staging, engineers should evaluate its severity will be on production. You can use kibana or other tools to evaluate the number of requests impacted. If the severity is high, [appropriate actions](/releases/#deployment-blockers) should be taken.

In particular, when the most used package registries (npm, Maven) are impacted negatively, consider the bug a higher severity. If the bug disrupts the expected behavior of those package registries, consider blocking the next production deployment with the appropriate actions above.

#### How we measure results

In order to better align our effort with our customer's needs we will use the following methodology to measure our results. We believe that our best measure of success and progress is our [product category maturity plan](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/#package). Progress towards these goals will be measured as follows:

1. The long term product category maturity goals will be split into each stage: [minimal, viable, complete and, loveable](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/)
1. For each catergory's next maturity stage, we'll break down each feature into small iterations and give them [issue weights](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/#issue-weighting)
1. These weighted issues will have the ~Package:P1 label applied then be scheduled in upcoming milestones
1. We'll measure our delivery by the percentage of committed product issues that were completed within a given development phase. Our goal is 100% completion. We track this measurement with a [Say Do Ratio](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#say-do-ratios).
1. We will resolve security vulnerabilities in a timely manner, based on severity.
1. We will reevaluate our ability to deliver on our long term goals in each iteration.

The process of making sure that there are issues to evaluate and break down is the responsibility of our Product Manager. It is the responsibility of the engineering team to evaluate each issue and make sure it's ready for development (using the ~"workflow::ready for development" label). It is the responsibility of our Product Designer to evaluate user experience and score our product maturity based on user research. This process will take some time to complete each time we achieve a new maturity stage. [MR Rate](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#mr-rate) will be used as an objective measure of our efficiency, not of alignment with our customer's needs or our organizational goals.

##### Product maturity goals

The below epics detail the work required to move each respective category to the next maturity level.

* [Epic with links to all current maturity targets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2972)
* [Container Registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2899)
* [Package maturity targets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2972)

#### Testing

To best understand how users use the GitLab package registry, when building and testing features, it is beneficial to test using projects that resemble real use-case scenarios. A Hello-World package is not going to simulate the same functionality that a large open source library or enterprise customer is going to experience. Depending on the feature that is being built, it is recommended during the development phase to test locally using a real package. Additionally, consider reviewing existing data to determine a good range of test cases. The package group has created an [ad-hoc test projects group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/package-stage/ad-hoc-test-projects) to store larger projects that can be used to test against. This group may contain copies of open source projects or projects specifically designed to test certain aspects of the GitLab package registry. It is not meant to be a static collection of projects, so the projects may be replaced, updated, or removed as seen fit.

##### File uploads

The package features regularly deal with file uploads. When testing these features locally using an environment like GDK, it is recommended to test changes using the default local storage configuration, but also using a cloud service for object storage. GCP is recommended when trying to best recreate the environment GitLab.com is running. For highest confidence in features working with uploads, testing using local storage, Minio, GCP, AWS S3, and Azure is recommended. The GDK docs have [instructions on how to configure for each of these providers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#object-storage-config).

##### End to End Testing

The Package team uses [GitLab QA](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa) for End-to-End testing. We have [guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/quality) for how our team is leveraging these tests.

#### Quality

The Package team has a goal of shipping enterprise grade software with a focus on Quality. The team accomplishes this goal with the following practices:

* Following GitLab's [Culture of Quality](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/#culture-of-quality_) with a focus on being champions for better software design.

* Partnering with our [Software Engineer in Test](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/software-engineer-in-test/) stable counterparts.

* Frequently [reviewing the code coverage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284185) across our functional areas (GoLang, Ruby, Frontend) and addressing low scoring areas as needed.

* Actively reviewing [Triage reports](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#triage-reports) and working with our Product Manager to prioritize bugs or regressions.

#### Risk Mapping

To better understand the risk environment and each risk's causes and consequences, the Package team uses the [Risk Mapping Tool](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/risk-map)) as their risk management tool to stratigically prioritise mitigation and increase Quality.

#### Code Review

Code reviews follow the standard process of using the [reviewer roulette](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#reviewer-roulette) to choose a reviewer and a maintainer. The roulette is optional, so if a merge request contains changes that someone outside our group may not fully understand in depth, people are encouraged to ask for a preliminary review from members of the package group to focus on correctly solving the problem. The intent is to leave this choice to the discretion of the engineer but raise the idea that fellow package group members will sometimes be best able to understand the implications of the features we are implementing. The maintainer review will then be more focused on quality and code standards.

This tactic also creates an environment to ask for early review on a WIP merge request where the solution might be better refined through collaboration and also allows us to share knowledge across the team.

##### UI or Technical Writing Review

When a merge request needs to be reviewed for the experience or for the copy in the user interface, there are a few suggestions to ensure that the review process is quick and effecient:
- When the MR has a UX or copy review, we suggest initating that part of the review process first to avoid experience changes in the middle of code reviews.
- A Product Designer will perform the UX review as well as the text review. If there is substantial change, the product designer may bring in a technical writer for a more thorough copy/content related review.
- If the tech writer us unavailable and the MR is being slowed down, it is possible to [create a follow up issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#post-merge-reviews) for the copy or documentation to be reviewed post-merge. This should be avoided when possible.

#### Community Contributions

We hold regularly recurring office hours to give community members or Contributors a chance to discuss any questions, issues, or merge requests. For details about upcoming office hours, check out [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2957) or the playlist on [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KoUyDaIiCFiHYcW7q2HeNKC).

##### Picking up an issue

If a community contributor wants to pick up an issue, or create an issue and a follow up merge request for it, please ping `@gitlab-org/ci-cd/package-stage` or an individual [team member](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/ci-cd/package-stage/-/group_members?with_inherited_permissions=exclude) on the issue itself before starting the work, this ensures that:

- The issue will not conflict with other work of the team
- The issue will have feedback and advice from a team member
- The issue is well defined enough to be used as a validation of the merge request

Additionally, the Package team can help set realistic review/merge times based on the scope of the work.

Ultimately the aim is to enable community contributor to deliver meaningful work with the least amount of back and forth and minimising the risk of stumbling on a show stopper.

##### Definition
A merge request with the following properties:
1. It impacts features or issues managed by the Package group. This means it has the ~"devops::package" label
2. Contributed by anyone in the wider community or at GitLab who isn't part of the Package group
3. Contributed by a team member who doesn't work in the same functional area (Frontend engineer contributing to Backend code)

##### Handling
A Package group member will adopt the community contribution with the following tasks:
* Set aside some time per week to assist and coach the community contributor.
* Make sure that the merge request has the proper labels
* Make sure that the effort is reviewed by the product manager and the product designer
* Make sure that the reviews are happening. You can even suggest reviewers.

##### Prioritisation
* Effort to support community contributions can range from weekly check ins to active contribution. As an organisation, GitLab values our community and the idea that everyone can contribute. As such, effort contributed to community contributions can range from simply checking in with the author to contributing actively. While this effort doesn't prevent us from delivering on our Package:P1 issues, we should invest the time necessary to make sure the author is able to contribute.

##### Scheduling

Given the number of community contributions submitted (thank you!), the Package team will include them in [Milestone Planning issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3591). We'll schedule time for team members to assist with the various community contributions as part of our milestone plan. You can view  guidelines for merge requests and a definition of done [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done).

The Package team will add review weight labels to community contributions to try to help understand the required effort and plan capacity. The intention is to help the team better plan for the support of community contributions among other priorities. We'll start with labels for weights of 1, 2, 3, and 5 similar to the weights we use for our issues. The only difference is that a package-review-weight::5 won't be replaced with an investigation. We will analyse our community contribution capacity in %"14.3".

Other points to consider for the Package group member:
* The coaching can range from commenting/reviewing the merge request to pair programming through Zoom.
* Contributing to features managed by the Package group can mean having to use the Enterprise Edition (EE) version of GitLab. This [guideline](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#for-contributors-to-the-gitlab-enterprise-edition-ee) will help with this aspect.
* Make sure that the merge request size and complexity stay at a reasonable level to ensure a [smooth review process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#contribution-acceptance-criteria).
* If the merge request grows to an unexpected size or tries to solve too many issues at once, consider suggesting to the community contributor to split it into smaller ones and use a [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/) if necessary.
* If a merge request gets stalled for a long time, consider suggesting that you will finish the merge request. Check the proper section in [Merge Request Coach responsabilities](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/) and the [closing policy for merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/#closing-policy-for-issues-and-merge-requests).
  * Do not forget to credit the community contributor.
* If some aspects of the merge request become a high priority task (for example, a bug fix) and the work from the community contributor is less active or stalled, consider suggesting that you will extract this part to a small merge request to get it implemented as quickly as possible.
  * The other aspects with less priority can still be worked out by the community contributor.

#### Missed deliverables retrospectives

When issues that we commit to delivering (have the ~Deliverable label) are not delivered in the milestone we commit to, we will hold an asynchronous retrospective on the miss to determine the root cause following the [guidelines outlined in the handbook](/handbook/engineering/root-cause-analysis/). In instances of a single issue, these retrospectives may be quite brief, in scenarios where we miss a larger effort, the root cause analysis will be more detailed. These should be conducted within the first week following the determination that we'll miss the deliverable.

#### Async Daily Standups

The purpose of the daily standup is to allow team members to have visibility into what everyone else is doing, allow a platform for asking for and offering help, and provide a starting point for some social conversations. We use [geekbot](https://geekbot.com/) integrated with Slack.

While it is encouraged to participate in the full variety of daily questions, it is completely acceptable to skip questions by entering `-`.

#### Async Issue Updates
The Geekbot asynchronous standup will be reserved for blocking items and merge announcements (merge parrot!). Our normal daily updates on progress and status will be added to the issues as a comment. A daily update may be skipped if there was no progress. It's preferable to update the issue rather than the related merge requests, as those do not provide a view of the overall progress. A weekly async update should be added to epics, providing an overview of the progress across related issues.

The status comment should include what percentage complete the work is, the confidence of the person that their estimate is correct and, notes on what was done and/or if review has started. It could be good to include whether this is a front end or back end update if there are multiple people working on it. Finally, for each MR associated, please include an entry for each.

Examples:
```
Complete: 80%
Confidence: 90%
Notes: expecting to go into review tomorrow
Concern: ~frontend
```

```
Issue status: 20% complete, 75% confident

MR statuses:
!11111 - 80% complete, 99% confident - docs update - need to add one more section
!21212 - 10% complete, 70% confident - api update - database migrations created, working on creating the rest of the functionality next
```

#### Weekly Retrospective

Our weekly retrospective is intended to provide the team an opportunity to retrospect on our week's effort. The discussion takes the usual GitLab asynchronous endabled synchronous meeting format: it has an agenda google document and we upload the video to [GitLab Unfiltered](https://youtube.com/c/GitLabUnfiltered). We currently have our retro every week on Friday morning (UTC-7) and, every 3rd week the meeting is held on Thursday afternoon (UTC-7) to support people in APAC TZs. The retrospective is a 25 minute long meeting.

The document is an ongoing list of retrospectives with a date heading as well as a link to the video after it has been uploaded. Each retrospective is divided into `what went not so well` and `what went well` in that order - so we can end the meeting on a positive note. In asynchronous style, we add our items prior to the meeting and read them out during the meeting. We read people's items when they aren't able to attend.

We roll up some of our retro thoughts into our monthly, milestone-linked, async retrospective. Ideally we will be able to address concerns in the retro. Action items are described during the meeting.

Examples of our retrospectives can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A/search?query=package+retro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A/search?query=package+retro)

#### Issue Weighting

| Weight | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| 1: Trivial | The problem is very well understood, no extra investigation is required, the exact solution is already known and just needs to be implemented, no surprises are expected, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.<br><br>Examples are documentation updates, simple regressions, and other bugs that have already been investigated and discussed and can be fixed with a few lines of code, or technical debt that we know exactly how to address, but just haven't found time for yet.<br><br>This will map to a confidence greater or equal to 90%. |
| 2: Small | The problem is well understood and a solution is outlined, but a little bit of extra investigation will probably still be required to realize the solution. Few surprises are expected, if any, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.<br><br>Examples are simple features, like a new API endpoint to expose existing data or functionality, or regular bugs or performance issues where some investigation has already taken place.<br><br>This will map to a confidence greater than or equal to 75%. |
| 3: Medium | Features that are well understood and relatively straightforward. A solution will be outlined, and most edge cases will be considered, but some extra investigation will be required to realize the solution. Some surprises are expected, and coordination with other teams or people may be required.<br><br>Bugs that are relatively poorly understood and may not yet have a suggested solution. Significant investigation will definitely be required, but the expectation is that once the problem is found, a solution should be relatively straightforward.<br><br>Examples are regular features, potentially with a backend and frontend component, or most bugs or performance issues.<br><br>This will map to a confidence greater than or equal to 60%. |
| **Larger: resize** | Features that are well understood, but known to be hard. A solution will be outlined, and major edge cases will be considered, but extra investigation will definitely be required to realize the solution. Many surprises are expected, and coordination with other teams or people is likely required.<br><br>Bugs that are very poorly understood, and will not have a suggested solution. Significant investigation will be required, and once the problem is found, a solution may not be straightforward.<br><br>Examples are large features with a backend and frontend component, or bugs or performance issues that have seen some initial investigation but have not yet been reproduced or otherwise "figured out".<br><br>This will map to a confidence greater than or equal to 50%. |

##### Issue size

Anything larger than 3 should be broken down. Anything with a confidence percentage lower than 50% should be investigated prior to finalising the issue weight.

Our intention is to break up issues that have a weight greater than 3, either by converting the issue to an epic with sub issues or just separating the work into related issues. An issue weight of 3 should describe something that would take **no more** than 2 weeks to complete.

When starting work on an MR that involves unfamiliar tools/libraries, be sure to update the estimated weight depending on who picks up the issue to reflect the additional time that may be spent learning. For example, a developer who has never worked with GraphQL before may need to spend some additional time learning the library versus a developer who has experience with GraphQL. If the first developer picks up the issue, they should consider raising the weight so it is reflected that it may take longer for them to deliver it.

### Partnering with Infrastructure

There are times during the development lifecycle that changes need to be communicated to the [Infrastructure teams](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/#teams). For example:

- If your work will impact rate-limits as in [GitLab-#778](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/778)
- If you are considering adjusting the existing [Package limits](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/instance_limits.html#package-registry-limits)

### Onboarding Enterprise customers

The GitLab Container and Package Registry currently handle hundreds of millions of events per week. However, when onboarding a large, enterprise customer it will be helpful for GitLab and the customer to understand their expected use case and workflows to ensure that the product scales reliably. When onboarding a new, large customer, it's helpful to follow the below steps:

1. Identify customer use cases and usage patterns;
2. Estimate the expected number of events based on the above, broken down by type and action;
3. Determine the percentage increase that the estimate above represents when looking at our current API request rate;
4. Discuss with Infrastructure and Package engineers whether the expected increase might be problematic or not.
