### Issue refinement

### Technical Discovery meetings

### Design pairing

### Planning

#### Milestone Planning

#### Weights

#### GitLab Terraform Provider

The [GitLab Terraform Provider](/handbook/engineering/projects/#terraform-provider-gitlab) is managed by the Orchestrate team.

### Scheduling

The issues scheduled for a milestone can be tracked at [Milestone Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4176401?label_name[]=devops%3A%3AOrchestrate).

#### Feature development

Our goal is to move towards a continuous delivery model so the team completes tasks regularly, and keeps working off of a prioritized backlog of issues. We default to team members self-scheduling their work:

- Team members self-assign issues from the [Milestone Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4176401?label_name[]=devops%3A%3AOrchestrate&?not[label_name][]=configure%3A%3Aparked) that are in the `workflow:ready for development` column and has the current milestone.
- Once a team member has completed their assigned issues, they are expected to go to the group issue boards and assign themselves to the next unassigned `workflow:ready for development` issue.
- The issues on the board are in priority order based on importance (the higher they are on the list, the higher the priority). This order is set by the product manager.
- If all issues are assigned for the milestone, team members are expected to identify the next available issue to work on based on the team's work prioritization (see below).
- While backstage work is important, in the absence of specific prioritization, the team will have a bias towards working on `bug` or `feature` categorized issues.

#### Bug fixing and priortized work

In addition to the self-scheduling of feature development, the manager will from time to time assign bugs, or other work deemed important, directly to a team member.

#### Organizing our backlog

### MR reviews

Team members should use their best judgment to determine whether to assign the first review of an MR based on the DangerBot's suggestion or to someone else on the team. Some factors in making this decision may be:

- If there is known domain expert for the area of code, prefer assigning the initial review to them.
- Does the MR require a lot of context to understand what it is doing? Will it take a reviewer outside the team a long time to ramp up on that context?
- Does the MR require a lot of dev environment setup that team members outside the Orchestrate stage are likely to not have?
- Is the MR part of a larger effort for which a specific team member already has all the context?

## Quality Processes

Maintaining a high standard of quality is a critical factor to delivering winning products.

Within the Orchestrate team we use the following processes and best practices to ensure high quality.

1. We ensure each MR is accompanied with meaningful unit tests and integration tests.
1. For each major feature we develop and maintain End to End tests that run nightly and confirm no regressions have been introduced to critical paths.
1. On a weekly basis, we review our [Triage report](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#triage-reports) for bugs and regressions and take the appropriate action.
1. We review the [quality dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/736012/Quality-Embedded-Dashboard) each milestone to track our long term progress at improving quality.

#### End to End Testing

The Orchestrate team uses [GitLab QA](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa) for End-to-End testing. We have [guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/Orchestrate/quality) for how our team is leveraging these tests.

## Error Budget

Our target availability is 99.95%


## Async Issue Updates

## Career Development and Promotions

We want every team member to be advancing in their Career Development.

We follow the Engineering Department [Career Development Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/career-development/).
