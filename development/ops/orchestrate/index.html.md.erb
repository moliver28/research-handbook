## Processes

### Acronyms 

- Engineers: All the Engineers of the Orchestrate team
- Engineering: Engineers and the Engineering Manager
- EM: Engineering Manager
- PM: Product Manager
- FE: Frontend Engineer
- BE: Backend Engineer
- UX/PD: User Experience Designer
- TW: Technical Writer

### Issue refinement

Every week the [refinement bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/refinement/) assigns a team member as the refinement DRI, who is responsible for refining **4 issues from the top of the `~"workflow::refinement"` list** (the list is prioritised top to bottom) in the [Milestone Board](#milestone-board) **and another issue of their choice** with a ping to the EM and/or PM explaining the reasoning.

The refinement process consists of:

- Follow the [refinement guidelines](#refinement-guidelines), assign a weight, and label the issue `~"workflow::ready for development"`
- OR Determine there is not enough information or too much uncertainty and clearly document the required next steps, and questions in the description and mention the PM, EM and/or PD for their awareness.

Note that it's expected that most refinements may need conversations with Product Manager, Product Designer, or Engineering Manager, and pulling in other Engineers when necessary is encouraged.

#### Refinement Guidelines

- [ ] This issue describes a problem to solve, and it's confirmed.
- [ ] This issue describes a proposal that outlines a solution for the problem to solve.
- [ ] This issue includes a UX proposal, if necessary, that is up-to-date and has been validated.
- [ ] This issue requires a technical proposal (e.g. link to the code to be changed), and it's added and up-to-date.
- [ ] This issue could affect application performance, and the concern is explained in the issue description.
- [ ] This issue could affect application security, and the concern is explained in the issue description.
- [ ] This issue is the smallest iteration possible and doesn't require further break down.
- [ ] This issue is linked to related, blocking and blocked issues, and it's up-to-date.
- [ ] This issue is labeled correctly.
- [ ] This issue requires PoC, prototype or Technical Evaluation due to its high complexity, and it's already finished.
- [ ] This issue description is actionable and clear, therefore a weight was added. If both ~backend and ~frontend work are required, add `~backend-weight::*` and `~frontend-weight::*` labels as well.
- [ ] Finally, add ~"workflow::ready for development" label to this issue.

#### Weights

#### GitLab Terraform Provider

The [GitLab Terraform Provider](/handbook/engineering/projects/#terraform-provider-gitlab) is managed by the Orchestrate team.

### Milestone Board

The issues scheduled for a milestone can be tracked at [Milestone Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4176401?label_name[]=devops%3A%3AOrchestrate).

This board contains all the necessary columns to track the workflow of the team, in particular:

- `~"workflow::refinement"` the list of issues that needs to be refined before they can be assigned.
- `~"workflow::ready for development"` the list of issues that are ready to be worked on, both assigned and not assigned to the milestone.
- One or more Milestone columns containing the planned work for the given milestone.

All the columns are prioritised top to bottom

#### Feature development

Our goal is to move towards a continuous delivery model so the team completes tasks regularly, and keeps working off of a prioritized backlog of issues. We default to team members self-scheduling their work:

- Team members self-assign issues from the [Milestone Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4176401?label_name[]=devops%3A%3AOrchestrate&?not[label_name][]=configure%3A%3Aparked) that are in the `workflow:ready for development` column and has the current milestone.
- Once a team member has completed their assigned issues, they are expected to go to the group issue boards and assign themselves to the next unassigned `workflow:ready for development` issue.
- The issues on the board are in priority order based on importance (the higher they are on the list, the higher the priority). This order is set by the product manager.
- If all issues are assigned for the milestone, team members are expected to identify the next available issue to work on based on the team's work prioritization (see below).
- While backstage work is important, in the absence of specific prioritization, the team will have a bias towards working on `bug` or `feature` categorized issues.

#### Bug fixing and priortized work

In addition to the self-scheduling of feature development, the manager will from time to time assign bugs, or other work deemed important, directly to a team member.

#### Organizing our backlog

### MR reviews

Team members should use their best judgment to determine whether to assign the first review of an MR based on the DangerBot's suggestion or to someone else on the team. Some factors in making this decision may be:

- If there is known domain expert for the area of code, prefer assigning the initial review to them.
- Does the MR require a lot of context to understand what it is doing? Will it take a reviewer outside the team a long time to ramp up on that context?
- Does the MR require a lot of dev environment setup that team members outside the Orchestrate stage are likely to not have?
- Is the MR part of a larger effort for which a specific team member already has all the context?

## Quality Processes

Maintaining a high standard of quality is a critical factor to delivering winning products.

Within the Orchestrate team we use the following processes and best practices to ensure high quality.

1. We ensure each MR is accompanied with meaningful unit tests and integration tests.
1. For each major feature we develop and maintain End to End tests that run nightly and confirm no regressions have been introduced to critical paths.
1. On a weekly basis, we review our [Triage report](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#triage-reports) for bugs and regressions and take the appropriate action.
1. We review the [quality dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/736012/Quality-Embedded-Dashboard) each milestone to track our long term progress at improving quality.

#### End to End Testing

The Orchestrate team uses [GitLab QA](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa) for End-to-End testing. We have [guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/Orchestrate/quality) for how our team is leveraging these tests.

## Error Budget

Our target availability is 99.95%


## Async Issue Updates

## Career Development and Promotions

We want every team member to be advancing in their Career Development.

We follow the Engineering Department [Career Development Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/career-development/).
