### Issue boards

The work for the Ecosystem Backend team can be tracked on the following issue boards:

- [Ecosystem BE Team Member Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2168283?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name%5B%5D=backend&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aecosystem&milestone_title=%23started) - Tracks ~backend andÂ ~group::ecosystem labeled issues by the assigned team member.

### Issue Labels

To organize, plan, and track our work, we use the following sets of labels:

- Use `workflow` labels as defined in [the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow). These labels help increase transparency into the current state of each issue. As an engineering team, we will typically use the following labels during development:
  - `workflow::ready for development`
  - `workflow::in dev`
  - `workflow::in review`
  - `workflow::verification`
- Use `Deliverable` label and `Stretch` labels as defined in [the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/interpreting-release-dates.html#intepreting-issue-states). These labels show what we have committed to for a given milestone.
