## About

The Ecosystem Backend team is a part of the [Ecosystem Group](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/ecosystem/) group in the [Create Stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#create-stage).

This page covers processes and information specific to the Ecosystem Backend team.

Slack Channel (internal): [#g_ecosystem-be](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01E55XNCEA)

## Process

### Issue boards

The work for the Ecosystem Backend team can be tracked on the following issue boards:

- [Ecosystem BE Team Member Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2168283?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name%5B%5D=backend&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aecosystem&milestone_title=%23started) - Tracks `backend` andÂ `group::ecosystem` labeled issues by the assigned team member.

### Issue Labels

To organize, plan, and track our work, we use the following sets of labels:

- Use `workflow` labels as defined in [the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow). These labels help increase transparency into the current state of each issue. As an engineering team, we will typically use the following labels during development:
  - `workflow::ready for development`
  - `workflow::in dev`
  - `workflow::in review`
  - `workflow::verification`
- Use `Deliverable` label and `Stretch` labels as defined in [the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/interpreting-release-dates.html#intepreting-issue-states). These labels show what we have committed to for a given milestone.

### Backlog Refinement

Every week the backend engineering team completes a backlog refinement process to review upcoming issues and provide weights so the issues can be planned and scheduled for upcoming milestones.

This process happens in three steps over the course of one week.

#### Step 1: Identifying Issue for Refinement

Every Wednesday the engineering manager will identify issues that need to be refined the following week. On average we will try to refine 3-6 issues per week. When picking issues to refine, here are some places to look:

- [Issues that have been recently updated but have no weight](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&weight=None)
- [Issues that are scheduled for the next milestone with no weight](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&weight=None&milestone_title=13.8)
- [Backend Performance issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&weight=None&label_name[]=backend&label_name[]=performance)
- [Backend bugs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&weight=None&label_name[]=backend&label_name[]=bug)
- [Application Limits](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&weight=None&label_name[]=backend&label_name[]=Application%20Limits)
- [All backend issues without weight](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&weight=None&label_name[]=backend)

Once identified, the engineering manager will apply the `Backlog Refinement::Ecosystem` and `workflow::planning breakdown` label, which will indicate the issues are ready for refinement.


#### Step 2: Refining Issues

Over the couse of the next week, each backend engineer on the team will look at the list of issues selected for backlog refinement:

[Current backlog refinement issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Backlog%20Refinement%3A%3AEcosystem)

For each issue, each team member will review the issue and provide the following information:

- Estimated weight
- Documentation that needs to be updated
- Testing that needs to take place
- Any security concerns
- How you would use iteration to break down the issue into MRs

During this process the issue description should be updated as more information is gathered.

#### Step 3: Finalizing Refinement

On the following Wednesday, after engineers have had a chance to provide input, the engineering manager will use the input to update the following information:

- Apply a final weight. This could be the average of weights provided by the engineers, but the final decision is up to the engineering manager
- Backend engineers update the description of the issue as needed to add information the came up during the refinement process
- Inform stable counterparts if there are any testing or security concerns
- Remove the `Backlog Refinement::Ecosystem` label and change the `workflow::planning breakdown` label to be `workflow::scheduling`

For any issues that were not discussed and given a weight, the engineering manager will work with the engineers to see if we need to get more information from PM or UX.
