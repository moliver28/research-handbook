## Backend Team Members

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Ecosystem') %>

## OKRs

Each quarter we have a series of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for our team. To find the current OKRs for this quarter, use [this issue list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=OKR&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aecosystem&label_name[]=backend).

## Metrics

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/ecosystem/ecosystem-be/metrics.erb") %>

## Work

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow]. To get in touch with the Ecosystem BE team, it's best to create an issue in the relevant project (typically [GitLab]) and add the `~"group::ecosystem"` and `~backend` labels, along with any other appropriate labels. Then, feel free to ping the relevant Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#g_ecosystem] on Slack.

### Collaborating with Counterparts

You are encouraged to work as closely as needed with stable counterparts including our PM. We should be sure to include documentation, UX, quality engineering, and application security in the planning process.

Quality engineering is included in our workflow via the [Quad Planning Process](/handbook/engineering/quality/quad-planning/).
