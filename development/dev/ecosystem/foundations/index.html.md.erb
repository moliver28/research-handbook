## Work

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow].
However, we work very closely with the Foundations UX Team.

To get in touch with the Foundations team,
it's best to create an issue in the relevant project (typically [GitLab], [Pajamas] or [GitLab UI]) and
add the `~"Category:Foundations"` label, along with any other appropriate labels.
Then, feel free to ping the relevant Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#g_ecosystem_foundations] on Slack.
