## About

The Integrations group is a part of the [Ecosystem Stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#ecosystem-stage).
We support the product with 3rd party integrations, REST APIs and GraphQL foundational code, and Webhooks.

This page covers processes and information specific to the Integrations group. See also the [Integrations direction page](/direction/ecosystem/integrations/).

Slack Channel (internal): [#g_ecosystem_integrations].

## OKRs

Each quarter we have a series of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for our
group. To find the current OKRs for this
[quarter](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/#fiscal-year), check the
[Integrations Ally page](https://app.ally.io/teams/44487/objectives?tab=0&time_period_id=135093&viewId=330300).

## Metrics

## Work

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow]. To get in touch
with the Ecosystem:Integrations group, it's best to create an issue in the
relevant project (typically [GitLab]) and add the `~"group::integrations"`
label, along with any other appropriate labels. Then, feel free to ping the
relevant Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#g_ecosystem_integrations] on Slack.

[Take a look at the features we support per category here.](/handbook/product/product-categories/features/#ecosystemintegrations-group).

### Collaborating with Counterparts

You are encouraged to work as closely as needed with stable counterparts
including our Product Manager. We should be sure to include documentation, UX,
quality engineering, and application security in the planning process.

Quality engineering is included in our workflow via the [Quad Planning Process](/handbook/engineering/quality/qe-subdept/quad-planning/).

### Workflow labels

The easiest way for engineering managers, product managers, and other stakeholders
to get a high-level overview of the status of all issues in the current milestone,
or all issues assigned to a specific person, is through the [Development issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1290820?scope=all&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aintegrations),
which has columns for each of the workflow labels described on Engineering Workflow
handbook page under [Updating Issues Throughout Development](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#updating-issues-throughout-development).

As owners of the issues assigned to them, engineers are expected to keep the
workflow labels on their issues up to date, either by manually assigning the new
label, or by dragging the issue from one column on the board to the next.

Once an engineer starts working an issue, they mark it with the `workflow::"in
dev"` label as the starting point. From there, the process primarily follows
the guideline:

``` mermaid
graph LR
  classDef workflowLabel fill:#428BCA,color:#fff;

  A(workflow::in dev):::workflowLabel
  B(workflow::in review):::workflowLabel
  C(workflow::verification):::workflowLabel

  A -- Push an MR --> B
  B -- Merged --> C
  C --> D{Works on production?}
  D -- YES --> Close
  D -- NO --> E[New MR]
  E --> A
```
