The Create:Source Code FE team is responsible for all frontend aspects of the product categories that fall under the [Source Code group][group] of the [Create stage][stage] of the [DevOps lifecycle][lifecycle].

[group]: /handbook/product/product-categories/#source-code-group
[stage]: /handbook/product/product-categories/#create-stage
[lifecycle]: /handbook/product/product-categories/#devops-stages

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Create:Source Code FE Team:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Frontend Engineering Manager, Create:Source Code, Delivery & Scalability') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] (Create(?!:)|Create:Source Code)/, direct_manager_role: 'Frontend Engineering Manager, Create:Source Code', other_manager_roles: ['Frontend Engineering Manager, Create:Source Code, Delivery & Scalability']) %>

## Iteration

We held an Iteration Retrospective in April 2020 in order to review past work and discuss how we could improve iteration for upcoming efforts.

* [Frontend: Iteration Retrospective (Source Code)](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/create-stage/source-code/-/issues/22)

Some overal conclusions/improvements
* Despite having improved the splitting of Merge Requests, we still tend to keep one issue spawning multiple Merge Requests.
* We'll be more strict about splitting the issues in foreseeable iteration steps upon scheduling/assignment
* We must keep in mind the overhead in review times when splitting up related backstage work. ([more info](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/create-stage/source-code/-/issues/22#note_342547093))

## Work 

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow]. To get in touch
with the Create:Source Code FE team, it's best to create an issue in the relevant project
(typically [GitLab]) and add the `~"group::source code"` and `~frontend` labels, along with any other
appropriate labels (`~devops::create`, `~section::dev`). Then, feel free to ping the relevant Product Manager and/or
Engineering Manager as listed above.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#g_create_source_code] or [[#g_create_source_code_fe] on Slack.

## Working with product

Weekly calls between the product manager and engineering managers (frontend and backend) are listed in the "Source Code Group" calendar. Everyone is welcome to join and these calls are used to discuss any roadblocks, concerns, status updates, deliverables, or other thoughts that impact the group. Every 2 weeks (in the middle of a release), a mid-milestone check-in occurs, to report on the current status of ~"Deliverable"s. Monthly calls occurs under the same calendar where the entire group is encouraged to join, in order to highlight accomplishments/improvements, discuss future iterations, review retrospective concerns and action items, and any other general items that impact the group.

## Workflow labels

## Async standup

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/async_standup.erb") %>

## Kickoff

On the first week of every milestone, we have a sync-call with every IC in which they take turns at presenting their plan for their Deliverables for the new milestone.

This usually happens at the first Thursday of the milestone (at least 5 days into it) at 3PM UTC.

## Retrospectives

We have 1 regularly scheduled "Per Milestone" retrospective, and can have ad-hoc "Per Feature" retrospectives more focused at analyzing a specific case, usually looking into the Iteration approach.
