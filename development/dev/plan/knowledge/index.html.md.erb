## Work

### Picking something to work on

The team [build board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5454834?milestone_title=Upcoming&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aknowledge) always shows
work targeting the upcoming release, organized into workflow columns. The ~"workflow::ready for development" column is ordered by priority.

The following labels are added by the Engineering Manager at the start of the milestone and communicate the priority of the issue to stakeholders:
* The ~Deliverable label indicates that we have committed to customers that we will deliver this item in the current milestone. 
* The ~Stretch label indicates that we have not committed to deliver the item but will attempt to make progress on it.

It's OK not to take the top item if you are not confident you can solve it, but please post in #s_plan or #g_knowledge if that's the case, as this
probably means the issue should be better specified.

### Capacity Planning

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/plan/capacity_planning") %>

Typically, 3-month rolling average is a good indicator of the team's capacity. Knowledge is a new team and determining capacity will be difficult at the beginning without clear historical data.

The PM and EM will work to fit ~Deliverable issues into no more than 75% of the team's capacity and allocate the rest to ~Stretch issues.

### Dashboards
