We have useful dashboards tracking the performance of parts of the application we're responsible for:

- The main [Application Dashboard]; showing request throughput, latency, SQL query counts, cache hits and Sidekiq jobs for Web and API endpoints. Also links to other useful resources in Kibana.
- The [Sitespeed Dashboard]; showing the results of ongoing synthetic tests against representative product pages. Useful for identifying changes in page load time (TTFB), LCP, etc.
