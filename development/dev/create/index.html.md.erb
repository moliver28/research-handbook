## OKRs

[OKRs](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/) should be updated at the beginning of each month at a minimum. We follow the company process of [maintaining the status of OKRs](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#maintaining-the-status-of-okrs) by updating the health status of each key result issue as well as providing informative comments where necessary. If the progress on an objective or key result has changed, update the title to reflect the new percentage of completion - for example, `Objective: Build a world class team => 100%`

## Narrow MR Rate Logs

At the beginning of each month, we evaluate the [narrow merge request rate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#development-department-narrow-mr-rate) from the previous month as compared to the data from the month prior. 

1. Navigate to the [Dev Sub-Department Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/561630/Dev-Sub-department-Overview-Dashboard) (internal only)
1. Refresh the data shown in the dashboard (upper right hand side) in order to ensure it is up to date.
1. Scroll down to the chart that reflects your team, titled "MRs / Engineer."
1. In the [Narrow MR Rate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i86_FNDNe2kX9krju5YOOkFCmqN2txFVlFEzH2nuknY/edit?usp=sharing) (internal only) document, find your team name under the previous months section.
1. Provide the data shown in the Periscope dashboard for the previous month and the month before that. Note the percentage increase or decrease. Provide an explanation as to why the narrow MR rate increased or decreased.

## Days to Merge / Iteration Coaching

We evaluate the merge requests that take an unusual amount of time to be merged in order to help iterate effectively and understand trends. This is best done at the end of each release, since we evaluate this data on a reoccuring basis.

1. Create a Google Sheet for your team with a table that looks like this:

| Team Member | Days to Merge | Issue | Is this related to the team processes? If yes, please explain | Is this related to the individual team? If yes, please explain | Is this an exceptional MR that could not have been broken down? |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| First Last | 94 | gitlab!1234 |  | | |

1. View the [days to merge dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/741733/Create-Stage-Days-to-Merge) (internal only)
1. Refresh the data shown in the dashboard (upper right hand side) in order to ensure it is up to date.
1. Identify the relevant merge requests for your team members in the tables where "days to merge" took more than 16 days.
1. Transfer this data into your spreadsheet, and evaluate it based on the table.
