## Is Management right for me?

The best way to determine whether or not management is the track you would like to pursue, is to learn more about what managers do through online training and discussions with Managers.

**Online Training**

There are some online training courses that describe the managerial experience:

**Role Playing Manager Real Life Manager Situations**

* [Role Playing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=teaching%20with%20role%20playing&u=2255073) is a very useful tool for a Manager to share Managerial situations with Invidual Contributors who are interested in becoming a Manager.
