## Is Management right for me?

The best way to determine whether or not management is the track you would like to pursue, is to learn more about what managers do through online training and discussions with Managers.

**Online Training**

There are some online training courses that describe the managerial experience:

* [GitLab Manager Challenge](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-challenge/)
* [New Manager Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/new-manager-foundations-2?u=2255073)
* [Succeeding as a First Time Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/succeeding-as-a-first-time-tech-manager?u=2255073)
* [Management Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/management-foundations-5/managing-performance-problems?u=2255073)

**Role Playing Manager Real Life Manager Situations**

* [Role Playing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=teaching%20with%20role%20playing&u=2255073) is a very useful tool for a Manager to share Managerial situations with Invidual Contributors who are interested in becoming a Manager.  



## How can I gain Managerial experience?

Currently as an Individual Contributor, your day to day tasks probably do not include managemement type activities. Below is a list of activities you can engage in to get managerial experience without actually being a manager at GitLab.

**Back Up Your Manager**

* Serve as a Backup Engineering Manager when your Engineering Manager is Out of the Office, which could include release planning, weekly meetings, and incident coordination
* Attend public meetings with your Manager taking notes (if necessary) and filling in when your manager is Out of the Office
* Monitor the #eng-manager slack channel for opportunities to work on Managerial related tasks
* Support the Engineering Manager with OKR related activities (Creating, Scoring, Updating)


**Hiring**

* Participate in Interviews
* Review issue roadmaps and priorities to identify capacity problems
* Serve as an [Onboarding Buddy](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/)



**Growing Others**

* Regularly provide [feedback](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/guidance-on-feedback/) in mentoring relationships, team retrospectives, issues, #thanks channel and Team Slack Channels.

**Initiate impactful change**
