## What did the Create Stage learn from the Survey?

GitLab asks team members to take time to complete an **Engagement Survey**. In the Create Stage we will be focusing on the following areas:

- **Growth & Development**
- **Recognizing Team Members**
- **Better Information Management**
- **Seeing Positive Action from the Survey**
