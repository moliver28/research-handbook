## What did the Create Stage learn from the Survey?

GitLab asks team members to take time to complete an **Engagement Survey**.  In the Create Stage we will be focusing on the following areas:

*   **Growth & Development**
    *   Scheduling at least one career development conversation per quarter
    *   Each Team Member completes at least one learning opportunity per quarter
*   **Information Management**
    *   Improving Communication methods so that team members are kept informed
*   **Seeing Positive Action from the Survey**
    *   Act based on responses from the survey
    *   Making actions that result from surveys more transparent

In an effort to model transparency for the work we are doing in the areas above, we will keep this page updated with non confidential issues / epics related to these efforts.  Each team will select actions that are applicable to their team.
