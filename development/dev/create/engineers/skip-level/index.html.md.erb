## How do we lead Skip Level meetings efficiently?

The Senior Manager meets with team members across the Create Stage in an effort to get a better sense of the work environment challenges facing the Engineers. Engineers have an opportunity to share their perspectives on everything GitLab.

This feedback will be a tool that we can use to improve communication and your work environment. For that reason, the feedback will be shared with your Manager. (If you have a topic that is sensitive in nature that you would like to discuss with me confidentially, we can reschedule a meeting specifically for that)

## Audience

This is the template used by the Create Stage Senior Manager. However this template is available if anyone viewing this template finds that it would be useful for their Skip Level Meetings.

## Async Meeting Prep

## Frequency

The Senior Manager conducts approximately four Skip Level meetings a month. The Senior Manager will likely meet with everyone in their reporting structure a minimum of once a year. In many cases the Senior Manager will meet with team members twice a year.

## What happens after the meeting

The Skip Level meeting is shared with your manager and your manager will then directly begin to address the concerns that were raised during the meeting.
