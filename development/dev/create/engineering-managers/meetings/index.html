## How are dashboards used in the Create Stage

Dashboards are used to **identify trends**, **analyze behaviors**, and **alert Engineering Managers to possible opportunities for improvement**.

Dashboards provide transparency and automation to Engineering Managers. However metrics or dashboards alone donâ€™t always tell the whole story. Engineering Managers use some of their investigation skills to determine what the **whole** story actually is.

- For example, a particular dashboard might show that an engineer spent 3 weeks on a merge request. Looking at the data alone, one might think the engineer needs to improve on their iteration value. However, the reality could be that the Engineer unexpectedly took 3 weeks off and that is why the merge request has not been worked on.

## Idle MR Dashboard

**Why do we use this [dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/694473/Create-Stage-Idle-MRs)?**

- Results:
- Collaboration:
  - Idle merge requests authored by team members
  - Idle merge requests authored by community contributors
    - Sometimes our community contributors author merge requests but for some reasons they end up becoming idle. This is a great opportunity to engage with the community about our product, tech stack support or even iteration coaching.

## Frontend Large MRs Dashboard

**Why do we use this [dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/804347/Create-Large-MRS---Frontend)?**

- **Iteration**: As part of our iteration value, we strive to break work down into small pieces. This board shows that there is frontend work that is very large, either having many files or many lines of code. This dashboard will alert team members to an opportunity to **improve iteration**!
