#### Code Review

Auth group works on components of the application that have a far-reaching impact. Because only a simple change can cause widespread support tickets and/or production incidents, there is less room for error which requires us to take these extra steps:

1. Auth merge requests will be assigned to another Auth engineer for first review in order to build more institutional knowledge across the team
1. Auth merge requests will include a comment that needs answered before merging, "Should this be behind a feature flag?" This is an effort to remind engineers about feature flag usage, but also to challenge reasoning as to why changes do not need to be behind a feature flag.
1. Auth related merge requests require review by an [Auth Engineer](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/manage/authentication-and-authorization/-/group_members?with_inherited_permissions=exclude). This is guarded using CODOWNERS feature of GitLab.
