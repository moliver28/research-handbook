## Manage::Import Escalation Triage
{: #welcome}

Due to known [reliability problems](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/importers/#reliability) with our existing importers, `group::import` frequently receives support requests to investigate and resolve failed or incomplete imports. The purpose of this Escalation Triage Process is to decrease the resolution time by doing the following:

- Introduces a Single Source of Truth to track progress towards a resolution. 
- Helps all stakeholders to fully understand the problem and determine who is involved in triage.
- Improves communication and accountability by clearly identifying a DRI from each department.
- Allows Engineering to properly prioritize any open escalation(s) against the current backlog of work.

## Process

To request support from the group, please create a new issue using [this link](
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/import/support/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Support%20Request) - note the use of the Support Request issue template.

**Note:** If as part of your investigation you believe you have identified a feature addition, improvement, or bug, we encourage you to also create an issue detailing your findings in the main [GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new), which can be referenced from your support issue.

Upon creation of the support issue the relevant team members will be notified and begin triaging and prioritizing the escalation within 2 working days.
