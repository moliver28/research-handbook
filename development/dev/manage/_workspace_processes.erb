Workspace works on components of the application that have a far-reaching impact and many groups will be involved in migratig features over, the following process is needed:

* Inradev and performance issues must be triaged by the EM and PM to determine their pririty based on the impace of the number of users efffected and how severe the problem is.
* Large scale projects (over 3 months of work) and mid-size projects (spanning over 1 milestone of planned work) will be organized in epics with clear iteration plans.
