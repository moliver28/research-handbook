When areas of the Import and Integrate codebase are changed, the [reviewer roulette](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#reviewer-roulette)
will recommend that the merge request is reviewed by an Import and Integrate team member. This will only happen when the merge request is
authored by people outside of the Import and Integrate team. See [this example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/74338#note_731247058) of how the review recommendation looks.

The [reasoning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343486) behind these special recommendations
is that other groups have some ownership of certain integrations or webhooks. Reviewing
changes made by non-team members allows us to act as owners of foundational code and maintain
a better quality of the Import and Integrate codebase.

### How roulette matches work

File paths of changes in a merge request are matched against a
[list of regular expressions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/240d4c37c955878c224718e47f4d527bea250299/tooling/danger/project_helper.rb#L42-62).
The roulette uses these hash values to recommend reviewer groups. For example, `:import_integrate_be` and
`:import_and_integrate_fe` will recommend Import and Integrate backend and frontend reviews respectively. As the regex matches
are [first match wins](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/54e182410219d1c77c5c6b2b7c88a6639f622cc6/tooling/danger/project_helper.rb#L18)
and not cumulative, any other relevant reviewer groups like `:backend` or `:frontend` must also be included
in each hash value.

The regex list should be updated to match integrations or webhooks code whenever needed. The list matches our
commonly namespaced files, so new code in existing namespaces will always match.

To see which files in the GitLab repository produce a match, paste the following in a Rails console:

```ruby
require Rails.root.join('tooling/danger/project_helper.rb')

ALL_FILES = Dir.glob('**/*');

def category_regexs(category)
  matching_categories = Tooling::Danger::ProjectHelper::CATEGORIES.select do |regexs, categories|
    next if regexs.is_a?(Array)

    Array.wrap(categories).include?(category)
  end

  regexes = matching_categories.map(&:first)
  Regexp.union(*regexes)
end

def print_files(category)
  regex = category_regexs(category)

  puts ALL_FILES.grep(regex).reject { |path| File.directory?(path) }.sort
end

puts "Backend:\n"
print_files(:import_integrate_be)

puts "Frontend:\n"
print_files(:import_integrate_fe)
```
