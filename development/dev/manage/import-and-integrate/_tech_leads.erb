Our group works with tech leads to help organize work on different topics and identify DRIs for them.

### Characteristics of a Tech Lead
A tech lead is:
- an individual contributor with additional responsibilities. Every engineer regardless of their seniority is qualified to be a tech lead.
- a temporary role that is tied to a specific topic/project. We allow the team to have multiple tech leads at the same time for different topics/projects.
- **not** a manager.
- **not** an additional seniority level.

The Tech Lead role provides growth opportunity for engineers who are interested in adopting leadership skills.

#### Responsibilites of a Tech Lead
Tech leads wear many hats. Their responsibilities may differ from project to project but may include:

- Technical Vision and Architecture - Defining and evolving the overall technical architecture for a given project
- Technical Guidance - Providing technical guidance and mentoring to other developers on the team
- Planning and Prioritizing Work - Organizing the work by breaking down bigger tasks into smaller actionable items
- Tracking Progress -  Tracking progress on committments and reporting status updates
- Risk Management - Identifying, assessing and managing technical risks that may impact deliverables
- Coordination - Overseeing the work of others and helping remove blockers
- Technical documentation - Maintaining documentation of the technical architecture and code structure for other developers
