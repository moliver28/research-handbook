#### Capacity planning

During planning we don't plan 100% of the team's capacity to go into deliverable work each milestone. Instead, we reserve a buffer of 15% per team member to allow for more time to research and scope work.

#### Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of our [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done). For any change that requires documentation, we may create a separate documentation issue that is linked to both backend and frontend issues. The frontend issue should be blocked by the documentation issue to prevent it from being closed prematurely. Backend will create a first draft and pass it on to frontend for adding screenshots and additional UI information if needed. The documentation MR and the feature MR(s) need to be merged in the same milestone.
