## Edcast / GitLab Learn


[GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/) is a Learning Experience Platform (LXP) meant to provide training and professional development for team members. We will continue being [handbook first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first), and use this platform to organize, surface, and promote relevant content that exists today.

We encourage you to browse all of the channels offered in GitLab Learn, as new ones are regularly being added and updated. Here are some resources to start:

- [**GitLab Development Channel**](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/gitlab-development-learning-hub) - for Development-specific training resources
- [**Recommendations from Learning and Development**](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channels/discover-channels/3635) - a collection of channels recommended by the L&D team, including Mental Wellness and Leadership Development
- [**All Channels**](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channels/all)


## Process for Contributing

### Step: 1:   Submit a Request

Submit a request to the [lxp-contributions project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/lxp-contributions) using this [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/lxp-contributions/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/development_channel_contribution.md) to the appropriate GitLab Learn Carousel DRI based on the table below:

### Step 2:  Carousel DRI Approves the Request

The Carousel DRI will review the request and approve or deny the request. Once approved, the recommended content will be added to the channel.

_Note: Carousel DRI's can only add content that exists in the platform already. If the content does not exist, the Carousel DRI will need to request that it be added first by consulting the [learning and development team](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/#core-team-members-and-roles)_


**Criteria for approval**

The following should be true for all content approved. 

1. A carousel cannot have more than 10 courses (There can be exceptions to the rule, however we only want to highlight the most impactful courses here)
1. The Carousel DRI must complete the course or have confidence that it will contribute to professional development
1. Upon evaluating the course, the Carousel DRI concurs that this course should be added to the carousel 

## What is a Carousel?

[Carousels](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/#carousels) are defined here by the Learning and Development Team. For the Development channel, they are used to collect different content (courses, videos, handbook pages, journeys) on the same subject.

## What is a Carousel DRI?

Carousel DRI's are responsible for curating the content for a carousel within the Development channel in GitLab Learn. They are formally [GitLab Learn Curators](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/team-member-contributions/#gitlab-learn-curator-pathway) and will organize and maintain learning content while encouraging professional development.

If you are interested in becoming a Carousel DRI:

1. [Become a GitLab Learn Curator](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/team-member-contributions/#become-a-gitlab-learn-curator)
1. Open an MR to this page to assign yourself as the DRI for a given carousel
1. Get approval from at least 2 DRI's
