## Welcome to the Fulfillment Group Page

### Who are we and what do we work on?

The Fulfillment team is responsible for the infrastructure between the systems which affect the user purchasing process, as well as being the primary caretakers of the customers portal and the license app. 

Since we overlap with the other groups in the [Growth Stage](/handbook/product/product-categories/#growth-stage) it can be hard to determine, who to go to for what. The other Growth groups focus on features, enhancements, experiments and pushing adoption and retention forward. We (Fulfillment) focus on keeping everything up and running, in other words, keeping the lights on. :high_brightness: 

We frequently collaborate with other teams. For example if we are making a change which will affect [usage ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/usage_statistics.html#usage-ping-core-only) we collaborate with the [Telemetry group](/handbook/product/product-categories/#telemetry-group). When our work involves or affects any backend enterprise application, we collaborate with the [Sales Systems team](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/).
