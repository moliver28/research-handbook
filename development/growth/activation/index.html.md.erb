## Vision

Group:Activation is part of the [Growth Sub-department]. We work on [connecting our users with our product value](/direction/growth/).

* I have a question. Who do I ask?

Questions should start by @ mentioning the Product Manager for the [Activation group](/handbook/product/categories/#activation-group)
or creating a new issue in the [Activation Workflow] board.

## Mission

The Growth:Activation Group works on product priorities and [growth deliverables](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/growth/#growth-deliverables)
with our [Growth product managers](/handbook/product/growth/)
and contributes to Growth initiatives including the [Registration Flow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4745) 
and [Continuous onboarding](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4817).

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Growth:Activation team:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Interim Fullstack Engineering Manager, Growth:Activation and Adoption', role_regexp: /(Growth:Activation)/) %>

### Group members

We work directly with the following team members in the Growth:Activation group:

<%=
other_manager_roles = ['Director of Engineering for Growth, Sec, and ModelOps','Senior Engineering Manager, Growth']
direct_managers_role = 'Interim Fullstack Engineering Manager, Growth:Activation and Adoption'
roles_regexp = /Activation/

stable_counterparts(role_regexp: roles_regexp, direct_manager_role: direct_managers_role, other_manager_roles: other_manager_roles)
%>

## Functional Counterparts

We collaborate with our colleagues in the Growth Sub-department teams:

<!-- * [Activation](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/activation/)-->
* [Adoption](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/adoption/)
* [Conversion](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/conversion/)
* [Expansion](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/expansion/)
* [Product Intelligence](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/product-intelligence/)

As well as the wider Growth Sub-department [stable counterparts](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/#stable-counterparts).

### UX
The Growth UX team has a [handbook page](/handbook/product/growth/) which includes [Growth specific workflows](/handbook/product/growth/#how-we-work).

## How we work

* We're data savvy
* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values/)
* Transparently: nearly everything is public
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on
* Everyone can contribute; no silos

### Prioritization

Prioritization is a collaboration between Product, UX, Data, and Engineering.

* We use the [ICE framework](/direction/growth/#growth-ideation-and-prioritization) for experiments.
* We use [Priority](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#priority-labels)
  and [Severity](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels) labels for bugs.

### Workflow

We use the [Product Development workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) when working on issues and
merge requests across multiple projects.

While not all of the work we do relates to the GitLab project directly, we use
[milestones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/) to track `Deliverables` and other enhancements.

#### Working boards

1. gitlab-org [Planning]
1. gitlab-org [Activation Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1158847?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aactivation)
1. gitlab-com [Activation Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1546862?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aactivation)
1. gitlab-services [Activation Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-services/-/boards/1546865?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aactivation)
1. Combined [Activation Workflow](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aactivation)

The above boards can be filtered by milestone to provide additional context around priority.
For example a `priority::3` security issue ([due within 90 days](/handbook/engineering/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues))
will be added to one of the next 3 milestones by the Engineering team during the `workflow::scheduling` stage to ensure that SLA is met.
