## Top-level Responsibilities

* Perform security research and develop proofs of concept that impact the Sec section.
* Maintain the advisory database(s) ([Gitlab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) 
 and [Community Advisories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/advisories-community)).
* Carry out [CNA](/security/cve/) duties.

## Mission

Vulnerability Research is a research & development team. While not being 
a product team, our work directly impacts the product. Our mission is to 
perform security research and develop proofs of concept that increase the 
capabilities and effectiveness of the [Sec section](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security/). 
Additionally, the team's mission is to share security expertise and practical 
experience. To learn more about the latter, you can follow updates to our 
[brown-bag sessions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/brown-bag-sessions) 
and the Gitlab blog ([#security](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags.html#security), 
[#security-research](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags.html#security-research), 
[#vulnerability-research](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags.html#vulnerability-research) 
tags in particular).

## Vision

* Drive innovative tools and techniques for identifying security
  issues and vulnerabilities.
* Leverage information security expertise to make new discoveries.
* Be a fixture of innovation within the security community.

@TODO: Update the strategy/vision for FY22+. Perhaps,
link to the proposed Direction page for VR.

### Short-term

* Keep on improving the advisory database(s) automation and maintenance.

### Mid-term

* Start graduating proofs of concept into products.
* Improve the current Sec section feature set. Focus on [DAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/)
 and [SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/).

### Long-term

* Continue developing innovative new features that may be integrated into the Sec section.

## Dogfooding

Ideally, research and proofs of concept produced by the team will be able to
be quickly dogfooded, with GitLab itself being the first customer. Successful
iterations of developed tools can then be transitioned into the product to be
made available to the wider GitLab community in an automated fashion.
<!-- TODO: Add examples -->

## Processes

* [CNA Processes](cna.html). Gitlab is a [CNA](/handbook/engineering/development/secure/glossary-of-terms/#cna).

### Priorities

The Vulnerability Research team uses the standard priority labels to determine
priority however those may carry a different meaning compared to the [usage in product teams](/handbook/engineering/#prioritizing-technical-decisions):

| Label        | Color  | Meaning |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| `~priority::1` | red    | The most critical task. Normally, only hull breaches should prompt a P1. Synonymous with incident. Examples: CNA/GemnasiumDB automation broke and needs to be fixed ASAP. |
| `~priority::2` | orange | Top-priority work. |
| `~priority::3` | yellow | A "roadmap" item. Large projects that we work on for months fall into this category. |
| `~priority::4` | green  | Tasks like discovery, nice-to-have PoCs, anything that we won't loose much by letting it sit there in the backlog. |

Any unlabeled issues are considered unprioritized, i.e. lowest-priority backlog.
