### Secure Analyzer Frontend

The Secure Analyzer Frontend team supports the scanner/analyzer groups beneath the [Secure sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/secure).

### Team members

<%= direct_team(role_regexp: /[,&] Secure/, manager_role: 'Frontend Engineering Manager, Secure') %>

### How to work with us

Given the number groups this team supports, we prefer to be aware of upcoming features as early as possible. During the time leading up to implementation we will strive to:

1. Understand the problem we are trying to solve.
1. Collaborate with the appropriate Backend team, Product Management and UX to identify an achievable MVC.
1. Work with the various Product Managers we support to understand relative priority.

We seek to have issues ready for backlog refinement activities by the 1st of each month, therefore allowing enough time for us to determine the 
appropriate implementation plan and finalize relative sizing of the candidate issues in a given release.

### How to work with the Quality team

#### Frontend Responsibilities 
1. Being able to identify what code changes would likely break E2E or System level tests and informing Quality.
1. Not to write E2E tests, but to catch potential failures and communicate gaps in coverage before landing to master.

#### Quality Responsibilities
1. To inform #s_secure-frontend of any upcoming QA meetings that would be of interest to the Secure team
1. [Quad Planning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quality-engineering/quad-planning/)
1. Informing Secure engineering of any failures encountered

#### Identifying potential breakages
1. Look to see if issue you are working on [has existing test coverage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/issues/736). These are the tests likely to fail

1. If you are working around code that contains a selector like `data-qa-selector="<name>"`, then there is likely to be an existing E2E test. Tests can be found by searching our [E2E tests in Secure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/qa/qa/specs/features/ee/browser_ui/secure).


#### Communicating changes that may break tests

Ping the DRI for quality assigned to Secure. You can find the person on the [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure/#team-members). If they are unavailable, then #quality on slack or the [triage DRI](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quality-engineering/oncall-rotation/#schedule) dependent on severity.

### Indicating Status and Raising Risk

All Deliverable issues should be marked `On Track` at the beginning of a milestone. If there is concern with doing so, then we should discuss why.
Issues that have not gone into review by the 8th may not have enough time to get merged. These should be considered Needs Attention or At Risk depending on their complexity and other factors.

Raising risk early is important. The more time we have, the more options we have.  Follow these steps when raising or downgrading risk:

1. Update the Health Status in the issue:
    1. `On Track` - there is no indication the work won't get merged by the 15th.
    1. `Needs Attention` - the issue is blocked or has other factors that need to be discussed.
    1. `At Risk` - the issue is in jeopardy of missing the merge cutoff of the 15th.
1. Add a comment about why the risk has increased or decreased.
1. Copy the Frontend Engineering Manager and Product Manager in a comment.
1. Copy the Backend Engineering Manager if there is associated backend work that may be impacted.

Note that an issue probably shouldn't go directly from On Track to At Risk.  Consider a progression: `On Track -> Needs Attention -> At Risk`.
