## Composition Analysis

The Composition Analysis group at GitLab is charged with developing solutions which perform [Container Scanning](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/composition-analysis/container-scanning/),
and [Software Composition Analysis](/direction/secure/composition-analysis/software-composition-analysis/).
See [the exhaustive list of projects](#projects) the group maintains.

## How we work

### Workflow

The Composition Analysis group largely follows GitLab's [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/).

#### Indicating Status and Raising Risk

We leverage [the issue's health status feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#health-status) to communicate the progress of the issue.

All issues should be marked `On Track` at the beginning of a milestone. This is currently done manually by the Engineering Manager.

Raising risk early is important. The more time we have, the more options we have. As such, the team reviews issues every week and discusses items that `Need Attention` or are `At Risk` to possibly course correct and re-assign resources based on the team's priorities.

Follow these steps when raising or downgrading risk:

1. Update the Health Status in the issue:
    1. `On Track` - the work will be completed within the planned milestone.
    1. `Needs Attention` - the issue is blocked or has other factors that need to be discussed.
    1. `At Risk` - the issue is in jeopardy of missing the cutoff to ship within the planned milestone.
1. Add a comment about why the risk has increased or decreased.
1. Copy the Backend Engineering Manager and Product Manager in a comment.
1. Copy the Frontend Engineering Manager if there is associated frontend work that may be impacted.

#### Experiments

In addition to the above workflow, the Composition Analysis group can be involved in some experiments, which might temporarily alter how we work.

*There are no experiments in progress at the moment.*

### Retrospectives

After the 19th, we conduct [an asynchronous retrospective](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/). You can find current and past retrospectives for Composition Analysis team in https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/secure-sub-dept/composition-analysis.

### Reaction rotation

On top of our development roadmap, engineering teams need to respond to additional requests (support, community contributions, security vulnerabilities).
This increases context switching and depending on the load this can drastically impact our ability to achieve our plan.
As a result, the Composition Analysis development team is actively reserving capacity each iteration to triage and address these requests.
Each milestone, an engineer is designated to handle each one of these responsibilities, by following the schedule defined in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/secure/-/epics/1). The rotation follows the development cycle, which means from the 18th of current month to the 17th of the following month.
The total time allocation represents around 10% of the engineering team.

#### Responsibilities - Security

Time allocation: 15% of 1 engineer.

1. Triage vulnerabilities reported on the projects we maintain and help resolving them depending on their priority. (See [Security vulnerabilities triaging process](#security-vulnerabilities-triaging-process))
1. Check for new security releases of our dependencies and ensure we use them:
   1. Upstream scanners (see [Updating an upstream scanner](#updating-an-upstream-scanner))
   1. Container base images
   1. Application dependencies
   1. Programming language
1. Consider creating or updating any automation or tooling (related to security, maintainership or support!)

#### Responsibilities - Maintainership

Time allocation: 15% of 1 engineer.

1. Triage and work with community contributors to help drive their MRs to completion. (See [Community contributions triaging process](#community-contributions-triaging-process))
1. Check for new versions of languages or package managers that we support, or deprecation / removal of support for the same and notify Engineering Manager and Product Manager via issue
1. Check for new versions of our dependencies (not related to security):
   1. Upstream scanners (see [Updating an upstream scanner](#updating-an-upstream-scanner))
   1. Container base images
   1. Application dependencies
   1. Programming language
1. Check in on test failures. Check relevant slack channels ([#g_secure-composition-analysis-alerts](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04UX9MQNSJ), [#s_secure-alerts](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CAU9SFKNU))
1. Check latest pipelines for any release failures. If any issue is preventing the automated release process from running, begin the [release failure escalation process](#release-failure-escalation-process).
1. Consider creating or updating any automation or tooling (related to security, maintainership or support!)
1. Monitor failures and errors on license-db project, use the `#f_licese_database` Slack channel for communication about these items, so other team members can provide the support.
   1. Check latest [scheduled pipelines of license-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-db/deployment/-/pipeline_schedules) for any failures. Ensure that pipelines pass or create an issue to fix the failure.
   1. Monitor the Slack channel `#g_secure-composition-analysis-alerts` for any incidents on the license-db infrastructure.
      1. In case of an incident react with :eye: to indicate that you are looking into it.
        - If the incindent isn't resolved in 30 minutes or more, investigate on it.
        - Write down in the insident Slack thread all the steps that were done to resolve it.

#### Responsibilities - Support

Time allocation: 15% of 1 engineer.

1. Monitor slack channels for questions, support requests, and alerts. While other team members may respond to these requests, the engineer assigned to the reaction rotation is expected to handle them primarily.
If a support engineer requests assistance via slack and it requires investigation or debugging, they should be directed to raise an issue in [a dedicated project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sec-sub-department/section-sec-request-for-help).
    - [#g_secure-composition-analysis](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CKWHYU7U2)
    - [#s_secure](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C8S0HHM44)
    - [#sec-section](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02087FTL5V)

    - [#g_secure-composition-analysis-alerts](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04UX9MQNSJ)
1. Monitor [Section Sec Request For Help](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sec-sub-department/section-sec-request-for-help/-/issues/?label_name=Help%20group%3A%3Acomposition%20analysis) project for support requests.
1. Triage bugs and resolve them when given `~priority::1`. (See [Bugs triaging process](#bugs-triaging-process))
1. Triage infradev issues and resolve them when given `~priority::1`. (See [Infradev triaging process](#infradev-triaging-process))

These items must be triaged continuously throughout the milestone which means they must be checked multiple times a week.

### Security vulnerabilities triaging process

We are responsible for triaging vulnerabilities reported on 2 sets of projects: our analyzers and their upstream scanner software. For the latter, we've set up mirrors to run our security scans.

#### Review FedRAMP vulnerabilities

We use the [security-triage-automation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/tools/security-triage-automation) tool to handle the following tasks:

1. [Process vulnerabilities for a given project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/tools/security-triage-automation#process-vulnerabilities-for-a-given-project)
1. [Resolve vulnerabilities and close their issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/tools/security-triage-automation#resolve-vulnerabilities-and-close-their-issues)

When using this tool to update vulnerabilities and issues, please keep track of the commands that were executed and add them to a private note in the reaction rotation issue.

1. On a weekly basis: review the vulnerability report to resolve no longer detected ones and close related issues.
    1. Visit `Vulnerability Report Dashboards` to verify that there are vulnerabilities that can be resolved.
        - [Analyzer vulnerabilities that are no longer detected][Analyzer vulnerabilities that are no longer detected].
            - Note: If you want to configure the report manually, select all [shared](#shared), [container scanning](#container-scanning), [dependency scanning](#dependency-scanning) and [license compliance](#license-compliance) projects, and apply the `No longer detected` activity filter and apply the `Confirmed` and `Needs triage` status.
        - [Upstream scanner vulnerabilities that are no longer detected][Upstream scanner vulnerabilities that are no longer detected]
            - Note: If you want to configure the report manually, select all [upstream scanner](#upstream-scanner-mirrors) projects, and apply the `No longer detected` activity filter, and apply the `No longer detected` activity filter and apply the `Confirmed` and `Needs triage` status.
    2. Execute the `security-triage-automation` tool to [resolve vulnerabilities and close their issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/tools/security-triage-automation#resolve-vulnerabilities-and-close-their-issues). This tool must be executed separately for each of the projects in the following categories:
       - [shared](#shared)
       - [container scanning](#container-scanning)
       - [dependency scanning](#dependency-scanning)
       - [license db](#license-db)
    3. Verify in `Vulnerability Report Dashboards` that vulnerabilities have been resolved.
1. As close to but not after the 1<sup>st</sup> of the month, `create` FedRAMP vulnerability issues by executing the `security-triage-automation` tool to [process vulnerabilities for a given project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/tools/security-triage-automation#process-vulnerabilities-for-a-given-project). This tool must be executed separately for each of the projects in the following categories:
    - [shared](#shared)
    - [container scanning](#container-scanning)
    - [dependency scanning](#dependency-scanning)
    - [license db](#license-db)

> All vulnerabilities **must** be remediated by their respective [SLA][Vulnerability SLAs]. This process only describes how to generate the required FedRAMP vulnerability issues required for the report.

#### Security Policy

We priortize findings by their CVSS severities and [SLAs][Vulnerability SLAs], and currently focus on security findings with these severity levels:

- Critical
- High

An exception is made for `Container scanning` findings - we focus only on findings with `Critical` severity.

Please utilize all the time you have set aside. If you complete all the ones at Critical and High, please continue to triage - we want to address all findings but we are working in a risk based order.

#### Triaging vulnerabilities

We use the Vulnerability Report with filters to focus on items matching [our policy](#security-policy) and reported on the relevant projects.

1. [Analyzers Vulnerability Report][Analyzers Vulnerability Report]
  - To configure the report manually, select all [shared](#shared), [container scanning](#container-scanning), [dependency scanning](#dependency-scanning) and [license compliance](#license-compliance) projects.
1. [Upstream Scanners Vulnerability Report][Upstream Scanners Vulnerability Report]
  - To configure the report manually, select all [upstream scanner](#upstream-scanner-mirrors) projects.
1. [License-db Vulnerability Report](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/security-products/license-db/-/security/vulnerabilities/?state=DETECTED&severity=CRITICAL,HIGH&projectId=39193358,39229232,39233486,39298809,39622674,40857363,45266022)

For each "Detected" item, investigate and either [dismiss](#dismissing-a-vulnerability) or [confirm](#confirming-a-vulnerability) it. If it's not clear whether there's indeed a threat, escalate to our [Application Security team](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/).

For vulnerabilities discovered in upstream scanners, an issue must be created in GitLab's issue tracker, and we should work with the relevant Open Source community to help provide a resolution. As a last resort, we can patch locally or fork the upstream project temporarily to fix the vulnerability sooner.

> Refer to [Vulnerability status definitions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-status-values) in case you are unsure of what each of them mean.

#### Dismissing a vulnerability

When there is no doubt a vulnerability is a false-positive, it can be "Dismissed".
Select the "Dismiss" option from the vulnerability status options.
Finally, make sure to comment on the vulnerability status change notification to explain why.

##### Low risk findings that can be dismissed

Because of both the way severity is generically set in CVSS and automated scanners do not have all context for an application, many findings which may be high risk in other environments or scenarios are low risk for our users. The containers ingest code from a user project and that user has developer access, and the containers are ephemeral and related to a specific pipeline.

In some other cases, a finding is related to an upstream dependency or Operating System and there is no fix available and no fix planned. Please be sure to mark this issues using the labels; blocked or blocked upstream.

When an issue is both blocked for a few releases and low risk you may dismiss the finding with a note as to the reasoning. If there is an open issue notify the Application Security team with your specific reasoning and close the issue (if applicable). In the future we will specifically want to tag everything related to these findings as won't fix or blocked when they are being closed, for now that is only available on issues and not findings.

The following class of container scan vulnerabilities can be considered low risk:
  - Many kernel-related findings will be at a decrease of risk and hence severity because of the way our process works with temporary containers with limited inputs which are developer-controlled.
  - Issues related to a software stack that will not apply to the analyzer e.g GUI related issues, issues in Bluetooth drivers, browser-related issues which require browser running in non-headless mode, etc.
  - S3 or S4 findings with complex exploit method or limited risk which have no fix available, or the upstream has stated there are no plans to release a patch.
  - Denial of Service (of the container/analyzer) as these containers run in ephemeral pipelines, are automatically stopped once a timeout is reached, and are accepting in code from users who already have developer access. This as a result is not an expansion of the risk profile.
  - Random number generator issues (where the numbers are not random) as we don't use random numbers for security purposes from the containers. (At the time this was last updated these were true, please use your knowledge of our analyzers or ask if unsure)"

  __To add items to the list above discuss repeatable finding patterns with Application Security, get approval from a leader in the security section, and add to this list.__

#### Confirming a vulnerability

If the vulnerability impacts a dependency:

1. Evaluate if the dependency (software library, system library, base image, etc.) can be upgraded *or* removed.
1. Set the vulnerability status to "Confirmed".
1. Release a new version of the analyzer with the dependency upgrade/removal and follow the process on [resolving a vulnerability](#resolving-a-vulnerability).

For all other confirmed vulnerabilities, [create a security issue](#creating-security-issues) to discuss and track the remediation.

#### Resolving a vulnerability

When a vulnerability has been remediated, it can be "Resolved". When doing so, comment how it was
remediated, then select the "Resolve" option from the vulnerability status options, and close the
related vulnerability issue.

#### Creating security issues

Unfortunately, creating a security issue can't be done yet via the "create issue" button from the vulnerability page or security dashboard as this only works when creating an issue in the same project where the error was reported and we've disabled the embedded issue tracker in our projects.

Instead, in our workflow we open all our issues in [the main GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues).

As a workaround, you can copy and paste the content of the vulnerability page (this keeps markdown formatting!). Please also follow our Security guidelines about [creating new security issues](/handbook/security/#creating-new-security-issues).

You can leverage quick actions to add the necessary labels.

    /confidential

    /label ~security ~"type::bug" ~"bug::vulnerability"
    /label ~"section::sec" ~"devops::secure" ~"group::composition analysis"

    <!-- depending on the affected project: -->
    /label ~"Category:Software Composition Analysis"
    /label ~"Category:Container Scanning"

It's important to add the `~security` and `~"bug::vulnerability"` labels as described above, because the [`AppSec Escalation Engine`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/engineering-and-research/automation-team/appsec-escalator/-/blob/3a7e8a4baed7b7e54039558f4f76328046543a0c/README.md#L3) will automatically pick up any issues with these labels and add additional labels `~security-sp-label-missing` and `~security-triage-appsec` as well as mention the issue in the `#sec-appsec` Slack channel. At this point, the [Stable Counterpart](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/secure/#stable-counterparts) or [Application Security team](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/) triage person will pick up the issue and assign a severity as part of the appsec triage rotation.

Once the issue is created, please add it to [the vulnerability's linked items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#link-a-vulnerability-to-existing-issues) for ease of tracking.

Developers reporting the security issue should help the [Application Security team](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/) assess the impact of the vulnerability, and update the issue description with an `Impact` section.

If immediate feedback is required, then add a comment to the vulnerability issue with an `@`-mention directed at one of the Security Engineers listed in the [Stable Counterpart](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/secure/#stable-counterparts) section, or ping them on slack.

### Community contributions triaging process

1. Leverage the group level [list of Merge Requests](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Acomposition%20analysis&label_name[]=Community%20contribution) with the Composition Analysis group label.
1. For each open Merge Request whose author is not a GitLab team member, investigate and help move it forward using the [Wider Community Merge Request Guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/merge-request-triage/#).

### Bugs triaging process

1. Leverage the [Bug scrub issues board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1077546?scope=all&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Asecure&label_name[]=group%3A%3Acomposition%20analysis&label_name[]=type%3A%3Abug).
1. For each open issue that has no Priority label ("Open" column), shortly investigate the bug (< 2h) and comment with your findings. Ideally you'd suggest Priority and Severity levels to guide PM decision. Depending on how confident you are, you can either set the labels by yourself, or make a suggestion in a comment, and ping PM.

   Track how long you actually spent investigating each bug in the [Composition Analysis Bug Triaging Time Tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCh6DTY9eUK26xXceO4ZUyuNlyv2AwXpKxvGGejieEg).

### Infradev triaging process

1. Leverage the [Infra/Dev issues board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1193197?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name[]=infradev&label_name[]=section%3A%3Asec) for Sec section. We target the whole section on purpose to cover a larger area and stay aware of other group's issues that could also affect us.
1. For each open issue that has no Priority label ("Open" column), shortly investigate the issue (< 1h) and comment with your findings. Make sure correct stage and group label are applied.

Please refer to our [infradev process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#infradev) for more details.

### Release failure process

If the image release process is failing, an incident should be created to track how
it was detected, escalated, and resolved. Documenting our incidents makes it possible
to search for previous incidents by keyword, labels, and other issue filters. We open
all of our incidents in the [main GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&type%5B%5D=incident&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Acomposition%20analysis&first_page_size=20).

1. [Open a new incident](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=incident&issue%5Bissue_type%5D=incident)
and add a description of the problem along with any reproduction steps. Add the following labels so that we can track the incidents
that have impacted composition analysis in the future.

    ```
    <!--
    Select one of the following severities
    Ref: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity
    -->
    /label ~"severity::1"
    /severity S1

    /label ~"severity::2"
    /severity S2

    /label ~"severity::3"
    /severity S3

    /label ~"severity::4"
    /severity S4

    <!--
    Select one of the following priorities
    Ref: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#priority
    -->
    /label ~"priority::1"
    /label ~"priority::2"
    /label ~"priority::3"
    /label ~"priority::4"

    /label ~"section::sec" ~"devops::secure" ~"group::composition analysis" ~"type::bug" ~"bug::availability"

    <!--
    Select one of the following categories
    -->
    /label ~"Category:Dependency Scanning"
    /label ~"Category:Container Scanning"
    /label ~"Category:License Compliance"
    ```

1. Assign the incident to the engineer currently on the maintainership reaction rotation.
1. Link any related issues or zoom meetings with the [quick actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/linked_resources.html#using-a-quick-action) to record incident timeline events. Ensure that an event exists for the incident start,
detection, resolution, and any other events that you feel are worth highlighting as part of the incident response.
1. Upon fixing the issue, include a detailed summary of the resolution and any initial follow up actions that should be completed. Lastly, an entry for incident should be added to the weekly composition analysis group meeting so that it may be reviewed with the entire group.

#### Example Incident(s)

- [PHP Composer segfaults in gemnasium analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383299)

### Maintenance triaging process

To help our Product Manager prioritize maintenance issues, the engineering team assigns them a [priority label](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#priority).

1. Leverage the [Maintenance issues board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2168528?label_name[]=group%3A%3Acomposition%20analysis&label_name[]=type%3A%3Amaintenance).
1. For each open issue that has no Priority label ("Open" column), shortly investigate the issue (< 1h) and comment with your findings. Make sure the correct sub-category label is applied per our [Work type clasification](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification) (e.g. `~maintenance::refactor`).

### Code review

Upon joining Composition Analysis group, team members are suppose to become either reviewers or maintainers for all [projects](#projects) maintained by the group. The process how to become maintainer is described in the general [Code review guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#how-to-become-a-project-maintainer).

## Projects

The Composition Analysis group maintains several projects to provide our scanning capabilities.

- [schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-db/schema)

### Upstream scanner mirrors

As some of our analyzers rely on open source software, we include them in our security testing to increase coverage and reduce risk.

To do so, we mirror their repository and execute our security scans on them:

- [trivy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/trivy)
- [trivy-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/trivy-db)
- [trivy-db-data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/trivy-db-data)
- [trivy-db-glad](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/trivy-db-glad)
- [vuln-list-update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/vuln-list-update)


The vulnerabilities reported on the currently used version of the scanner are automatically reported in [the group level Vulnerability Report][Upstream scanners Vulnerability Report] and triaged as part of our [security vulnerabilities triaging process](#security-vulnerabilities-triaging-process).

#### Setting up a mirror

1. create a new project in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies (blank project).
2. set up the project repository as [a pull mirror](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html#pulling-from-a-remote-repository) of the upstream repository.
3. find the git tag that matches the version currently used by our analyzer (usually represented by the `SCANNER_VERSION` variable in the analyzer's `Dockerfile`). Use exact commit if there is no git tag for the corresponding release we use.
4. create a branch from that ref following naming convention `VERSION-security-checks` where `VERSION` is the version of the upstream scanner we currently use (e.g. `v6.12.0`).
5. add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file to configure all compatible security scans.
6. make `VERSION-security-checks` the default branch, so that reported vulnerabilities are showing up on the dashboards and vulnerability reports.

#### Updating an upstream scanner

We check for new releases of the upstream scanners on a monthly basis, as part of our [release issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/release/-/blob/master/scripts/templates/release_issue.md.erb). When an update is available, a new issue is created using the [update scanner issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/release/-/blob/master/scripts/templates/update_scanner_issue.md.erb) and added to the next milestone.

Every analyzer relying on an upstream scanner has a "*How to update the upstream Scanner*" section in their readme detailing the process. This includes a verification for possible new security vulnerabilities and a license check which are detailed below.

##### Security checks when updating an upstream scanner

Before releasing an analyzer with a newer version of its upstream scanner, we must ensure it is exempt of security vulnerabilities matching our current policy.

1. checkout the new tag (or commit) and create a new branch from it following naming convention `NEW_VERSION-security-checks`.
1. copy/paste the existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file from the current `VERSION-security-check` branch.
1. if there are new findings matching [our policy](#security-policy), address them according to our [triage process](#triaging-vulnerabilities).
1. only when above mentionned findings are **fixed**, update the default_branch to be `NEW_VERSION-security-checks` and proceed with the update of the analyzer to use this newer version.

##### License check when updating an upstream scanner

Before releasing an analyzer with a newer version of its upstream scanner, we must ensure its license has not changed or is still compatible with [our policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/open-source/#acceptable-licenses).
