Although we have a bias for asynchronous communication, synchronous meetings are necessary and should adhere to our [communication guidelines](/handbook/communication/#video-calls). Some regular meetings that take place in Compliance are:

| Frequency | Meeting                              | DRI         | Possible topics                                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Weekly (alternating between APAC/EMEA and AMER)    | Group-level meeting                  | Engineering Manager | Ensure current release is on track by walking the board, unblock specific issues                       |
| Monthly   | Planning meeting                    | Product Manager         | See [Planning](#milestone-planning) section |

For one-off, topic specific meetings, please always consider recording these calls and sharing them (or taking notes in a publicly available document).

Agenda documents and recordings can be placed in the [shared Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ALpc3GhrDkKwUk9PVA) (internal only) as a single source of truth.

Meetings that are not 1:1s or covering confidential topics should be added to the Govern Shared calendar.

All meetings should have an agenda prepared at least 12 hours in advance. If this is not the case, you are not obligated to attend the meeting. Consider meetings canceled if they do not have an agenda by the start time of the meeting.
