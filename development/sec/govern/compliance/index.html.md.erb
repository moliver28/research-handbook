### Govern:Compliance
{: #welcome}

## What we work on
* We use the [Group Direction page](/direction/govern/compliance/) to describe our high-level goals and direction for our group.
* From the high-level goals and direction we filter down to a prioritised list of Epics and Issue, that we use when planning each Milestone. This prioritised list we try to keep updated in our [Planning Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/govern/compliance/-/epics/2)
  * In addition to using the high-level goals and direction as an input to planning Milestones, the Compliance Product Manager considers input from Sales, customers, and internal stakeholders (dogfooding) to decide on the priority for the issues added to each Milestone.
* We also use [OKRs](/company/okrs/) to help prioritise strategic initiatives within the group. We use Issues for planning and collate them in our [OKR Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/govern/compliance/-/epics/4)

## How we work
* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values/).
* Transparently: nearly everything is public, we record/livestream meetings whenever possible.
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on.
* Everyone can contribute; no silos.
  * The goal is to have product give engineering and design the opportunity to be involved with direction and issue definition from the very beginning.
* We do an optional, asynchronous daily stand-up in our stand-up channel:
