### Planning

Our [Planning issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/govern/authorization/team-tasks/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=Planning%20Issue) are the SSOT of what we're working on now, and what we're working on next. To maintain the issue lists, leadership (EM+PM) will keep the lists triaged.

* Issues that are `~workflow::ready for development` should be picked up in order of Priority. With `~priority::1` being the highest priority.
* Issues that are `~workflow::scheduling` or are lacking a `~workflow` label shouldn't be picked up, and should be triaged by leadership during the planning phase.
