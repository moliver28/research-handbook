## Why does this page exist?

In the spirit of establishing a [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) for each set of functionality where this may not be obvious, the purpose of this page is to explicitly define which engineering group has reponsibility for which portions of the product and for specific decisions.

## Page/Function responsibilities

###	Security Dashboards

Displays summary of vulnerabilities and allows management of the list of vulnerabilities - [instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#instance-security-dashboard), [group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#group-security-dashboard), [project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#project-security-dashboard).

* Primary Development Group: [Secure by their categories](/handbook/product/product-categories/#secure-stage)
* Engineering sub-department: Secure


###	Interacting with the vulnerabilities

View, Dismiss, or Confirm (and create related Issue) vulnerability findings the configured scanners detect. This applies to all locations where we display a finding (dashboards, pipeline view, MR view. Also includes the generic auto-remediation flow (though the remediation data itself is provided by the analyzers so fall under the corresponding group for implementation)

* [Example](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/index.html#interacting-with-the-vulnerabilities)
* Product Manager: Matt Wilson
* Primary Development Group: [Secure:Threat Insights](/handbook/product/product-categories/#threat-insights-group)
* Engineering sub-department: Threat Management


## [Security Report Schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas)

_Draft_

Matt Wilson (for PM) and Thiago Figueiro (for EM) will be the DRIs for approving changes to the [security report schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas). In case they're unavailable, their backup is David and Wayne.

### Approval process

Issue and Merge Request templates `Security Report Schema` will be used to make the DRIs and their backup aware of the change. These templates will mention their GitLab account names so they are automatically informed when a change is proposed and implemented.

They will have checkboxes that they will need to check to acknowledge their review/approval.
