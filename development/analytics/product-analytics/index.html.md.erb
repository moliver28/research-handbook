## Vision

The Product Analysis Group is part of the [Analytics section](/handbook/product/categories/analytics/).

How we work:
- We work in accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values/).
- We work [transparently](/handbook/values/#transparency) with everything public.
- We have a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action).
- Everyone can contribute to our work.

Learn more about what we work on and the problems we are solving on our public [direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/analytics/product-analytics/).

## Onboarding engineer? Start here.

Welcome! Start by familiarizing yourself with the [developer onboarding guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/developer-onboarding/). After that you'll need to set up a few things specific to the Product Analytics team.

### Docker

We use Docker to run our development environment. You can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Free alternatives such as Rancher are not fully compatible with our development stack.

Docker is not expensable, so you will need to open an access request to get a valid license. Further instructions are [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/mac/#docker-desktop).

### DevKit

Our internal development kit is a Docker Compose project which will run the entire product analytics stack.

It is pre-configured and the [repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-analytics/devkit) contains all the required information and steps to get started.

### GDK

Follow the [GDK documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/doc/howto/product_analytics.md) on how to set up your GDK for product analytics.

## Communication

### Slack

We have dedicated Slack channels for the Product Analytics group:

* `#g_monitor_product_analytics` for general posts.
* `#g_monitor_product_analytics_daily` for our daily asynchronous stand-ups.
* `#g_monitor_product_analytics_frontend` for the monthly frontend retrospective and kickoff.
* `#g_monitor_product_analytics_infra_alerts` for infrastructure alerts.

### Meetings

* Our weekly sync meeting switches fortnightly on Tuesdays between EMEA/AMER (1400UTC) and AMER/APAC (1930UTC) friendly times. Attendance is not mandatory (although encouraged, if you are available) and the meeting is recorded on GitLab Unfiltered. You can find the meeting link in the `#g_monitor_product_analytics` channel.
* All analytics meetings can be found by searching for the `Analytics Shared` meeting room in Google calendar and all GitLab team members are welcome to join.
