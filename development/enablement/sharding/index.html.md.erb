## Vision

The Sharding Group is the direct outcome of applying our value of [Iteration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration) to the direction of the [Database Scalability Working Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/database-scalability/). There are multiple proposals and ideas on increasing database scalability through different sharding implementations. The charter of this group is to explore some of these ideas, quickly iterate on them and validate proposals to provide a solution for scaling our database to accommodate 10 Million Daily Active Users (DAU) of GitLab.com, and lead the efforts to eventually implement the first iteration (MVC) of a sharded database that works with GitLab application at scale. As we iterate on these ideas, the list of potential outcomes includes:
1. Incremental steps towards a larger sharding solution
1. Defining work for various groups to implement sharding for their stage
1. Blueprints for next steps as we expand the sharding implementations
1. Case studies on why a proposal will not work
1. The first iteration (MVC) of a sharded PostgreSQL database that works with the GitLab application

As we brainstorm and iterate on sharding proposals, we will provide implementation details, prototypes, metrics, demos and documentation to support our hypotheses and outcomes.

## Team IC Gearing
**Exception Ratio**: 1 Distinguished Engineer, 3 Staff Engineers : Team

**Justification**: The Sharding team was formed exclusively to implement a sharding solution to solve our database limitations as outlined by the [Database Scalability Working Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/database-scalability/). The project requires in-depth knowledge of PostgreSQL as well as into the application itself. To borrow some phrasing from the working group: _we recognize this problem cannot be solved to meet our needs and requirements if we limit ourselves to the database: we must consider careful changes in the application to make it a reality_. With that being said, the DRI had to be selective to ensure a small team of 5 can achieve the above requirements to cover every corner of our database and codebase. All candidates were selected based on the required skills profile for the success of the project, to make the best mix and match by covering a spectrum of interests with a minimal group.

## Meetings
Where we can we follow the GitLab values and communicate asynchronously.  However, there have a few important recurring meetings.  Please reach out to the [#g_sharding](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01TQ838Y3T) Slack channel if you'd like to be invited.

## Work
We follow the GitLab [engineering workflow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/) guidelines.  To bring an issue to our attention please add the `~"group::sharding"` label along with any other relevant labels.  If it is an urgent issue, please reach out to the Product Manager or Engineering Manager listed in the [Stable Counterparts](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/sharding/#stable-counterparts) section above.

### Planning

We have the following boards for tracking our work (listed below). 

#### Boards

- [Sharding: Build](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2594854?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name[]=group%3A%3Asharding) for issues assigned specifically to `~"group::sharding"`
- [Database Scalability Working Group ](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2502942?label_name[]=wg_database-scalability) for issues related to database scalability efforts that span multiple teams
