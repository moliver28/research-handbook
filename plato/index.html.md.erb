---

## Program Overview
GitLab has partnered with Plato HQ for an external Mentoring Program.

## How does it work?

1. A GitLab Team Member is recommended by their Manager to participate in the program.
2. All Mentees are invited to a KickOff Meeting with Plato
3. Mentees select one Mentor after viewing three Mentor Plato Profiles while on a Plato Call 
4. Plato sets up the framework / software to support the Mentoring Relationship
     * Plato schedules meetings and Zoom sessions (that are recorded) 
     * Plato invites Mentees to Seminars where you hear guest speakers from other companies
5. Mentees and Mentors meet (average meeting time is 30 minutes) on a regular cadence (typically bi-weekly) based on their preferences
6. Mentees create all of the Agenda and are the main drivers of the relationship

## Benefits
