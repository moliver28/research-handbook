## Overview

This program allows team members at GitLab to volunteer and donate their time and technical skills (such as programming or Linux administration) to provide knowledge, support, and coaching to members of underrepresented groups (URGs) in the technology industry. The hope is we can help people who have been denied opportunity for whatever reason, and desire to get their first job in the technology industry.

## Volunteer Coaches

Team members at GitLab interested in helping out through the program should reach out to the individual listed as the "GitLab Contact in the list of partners below.

## Indiviuals Recieving Coaching

We're open to any skill level but the individuals recieving coaching would typically be preparing for something like our [GitLab Engineering Internship Program](/handbook/engineering/internships/), which might subsequently turn into fulltime employement. If you are someone interested in entering this program to receive coaching, please contact the vendors below and follow their admission process. Feel free to communicate that you would like to work with a coach from GitLab if it can be arranged.

## Partners

To make this program as scalable as possible we partner with other organizations that run their own education, training, coaching, or mentorship programs. They already have processes, curriculum, students, and coaches. GitLab supplies additional coaches through this program. If you run such an organization and would like to tap into our pool of coaches, please contact [Roos Takken](https://gitlab.com/rtakken) or [Giuliana Lucchesi](https://gitlab.com/glucchesi), People Ops Business Partners who work with GitLab Engineering.

Here is a little bit about **Latinitas** in [their own words](https://latinitasmagazine.org/about-us/):

> Latinas are underestimated and underrepresented. Itâ€™s time for Latinas to know that they are important; they deserve to see their experiences reflected honestly and accurately.
> Through after-school clubs, camps, events and publications, and channels, we provide a space, both in the physical and online, for girls to express themselves, develop their skills, learn about their culture and discover their unique voice.
