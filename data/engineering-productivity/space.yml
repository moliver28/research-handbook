- name: Team member retention
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/engineering-productivity/space/"
  definition: We need to be able to retain talented team members. Retention measures our ability to keep them sticking around at GitLab. Team Member Retention = (1-(Number of Team Members leaving GitLab/Average of the 12 month Total Team Member Headcount)) x 100. GitLab measures team member retention over a rolling 12 month period. This is an internal metric.
  target: at or above 84%

- name: Escape Rate
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/engineering-productivity/space/"
  definition: This shows the rate that bugs are created. It is the ratio of opened bugs to the number of MRs merged. As an example, an escape rate of 10% indicates that, on average, for every 10 MRs merged we will see 1 bug opened. Looking at the escape rate helps us understand the quality of the MRs we are merging.
  target: Currently no target is set for this metric. We need to establish a baseline and consider the right balance between velocity and quality.
