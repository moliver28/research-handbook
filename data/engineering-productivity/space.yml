- name: Team member retention
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/engineering-productivity/space/"
  definition: We need to be able to retain talented team members. Retention measures our ability to keep them sticking around at GitLab. Team Member Retention = (1-(Number of Team Members leaving GitLab/Average of the 12 month Total Team Member Headcount)) x 100. GitLab measures team member retention over a rolling 12 month period. This is an internal metric.
  target: at or above 84%

- name: Escape Rate
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/engineering-productivity/space/"
  definition: This shows the rate that bugs are created. It is the ratio of opened bugs to the number of MRs merged. As an example, an escape rate of 10% indicates that, on average, for every 10 MRs merged we will see 1 bug opened. Looking at the escape rate helps us understand the quality of the MRs we are merging.
  target: Currently no target is set for this metric. We need to establish a baseline and consider the right balance between velocity and quality.

  definition: We want to be more intuitive with calculating how long it takes an MR to merge or close. Open MR Age (OMA) measures the median time of all open MRs as of a specific date. In other words, on any given day, we calculate the number of open MRs and median time in open state for those MRs at that point in time.
