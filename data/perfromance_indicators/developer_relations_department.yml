- name: MRARR
  base_path: "/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/performance-indicators/"
  definition: MRARR (pronounced "mer-arr," like a pirate) is the measurement of Merge Requests from customers, multiplied with
    the revenue of the account (ARR) from that customer. This measures how active our biggest customers are contributing to GitLab.
    We believe the higher this number the better we'll retain these customers and improve product fit for large enterprises.
    The unit of MRARR is MR Dollars (MR$). MR Dollars is different than the normal Dollars which is used for ARR.
    We are tracking current initiatives to improve this in this <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1225">epic</a>. <figure class="video_container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjWwpPU3KDU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe></figure>
