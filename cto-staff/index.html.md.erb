## Engineering Staff Meeting

The Engineering Staff meeting happens weekly on alternating time slots: one that is afternoon / early evening in EMEA and morning in AMER, and another that is afternoon in AMER and morning in APAC.

Anyone at GitLab is welcome to attend and contribute to the agenda. The agenda is internal only, please search in Google Drive for 'Engineering Staff Meeting'. Typical attendees are

1. The CTO.
2. The CTO's direct reports.
3. The [Acting Chief of Staff to the CTO](#acting-chief-of-staff-to-the-cto-rotation).
4. [People Business Partners](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) for Engineering.
5. The EBA to the CTO.

## Acting Chief of Staff to the CTO Rotation

The acting of Chief of Staff to the CTO role is an opportunity for anyone in Engineering with an interest in leadership and upper management to get exposure. The acting role is there to make the rest of CTO Staff (CTO's direct reports) more effective. For more information check out the [job family](/job-families/engineering/acting-cos-to-the-cto/) for this acting position.

### How the rotation works
Similar to our [CEO Shadow Program](/handbook/ceo/shadow/), this role is a temporary assignment which is rotated. The rotation time commitment is 3 months full time, with 5-10% time commitment on either end of the 3 month time period. The structure will look like:

- Month 0 (prior to beginning) = 5-10% time commitment to attend key meetings and prep for your rotation.
- Month 1-3 = full time
- Month 4 (after ending your rotation) = 5-10% time commitment to attend key meetings and transition responsibilities

Examples of "key meetings" are: OKR kickoff, OKR retrospective, key reviews, etc.

Besides this, it’s important to consider the following:
- Your compensation would remain the same
- You could live in any region (APAC/EMEA/AMER)
- Following your rotation, you'd return to your role prior to the rotation
- You will report directly to the CTO for the duration of your term

### Criteria for selection
You are eligible to apply for this rotation if you have been with GitLab for at least 3 months. Candidates will be selected based on:
- Interest
- Availability for a 3-month, full-time rotation and availability to join important meetings prior and after (5-10%)
- Team members interested in applying should confirm availability from a bandwidth perspective with their manager prior to applying
- Performance in current role
- Good standing within GitLab (for example, not on a PIP or recently received a written warning)
- Participation in [Team Member Resource Groups](/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/) is a nice-to-have

**In keeping with our DIB value, we do extra work to make certain that members of underrepresented groups are aware of the opportunity, feel welcome to apply, and have equal opportunity to serve a term.**

### Registration process
If you’re interested in the rotation for acting Chief of Staff to the CTO you can register via this [Application form](https://forms.gle/KyfEsQ7nzgFxTxNC8). Responses will be collected by the People Business Partner and CTO. Once the window for application closes the CTO, CTO Staff and People Business Partner will calibrate on selecting a candidate to start the rotation.

### Selection process
The registration form opens the second week of each quarter of the fiscal year and remains open for 3 weeks (I.E. The registration form for FY'23 Q1 applicants will open the second week of Q4 FY'22 - November 2021). Candidates will be selected by CTO Staff in the second month of the quarter, so that they have enough time to ensure backup for their role.

The selection process involves coffee chats with the CTO and a VP of one of the Engineering departments.

Candidates who are not selected for the upcoming rotation, but are eligible, will be given priority if they apply to the next quarter’s rotation.
