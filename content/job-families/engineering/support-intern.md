## Support Engineer Intern

### Job Grade

The Support Engineer Intern is a [grade 4](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#gitlab-job-grades).

### What you can expect in a Support Engineer Intern role at GitLab

As a Support Engineer Intern, you will work for a 10 week period embedded within GitLab Support. During this time you will play a backstage role learning, helping support customers and augmenting GitLab's product and documentation. You will:

- reproduce and isolate bugs reported by customers and document any known workarounds
- create bug reports and feature requests on the behalf of customers
- author documentation updates and knowledge base articlts based on support ticket findings
- participate in team meetings to discuss ongoing issues and share knowledge
- collaborate with our [Product](/handbook/product/) and [Development](/handbook/engineering/development/) Teams to build new features and fix bugs
- continually research and learn the current and future best practices of using GitLab
- suggest and implement improvements to Support workflows and tooling

### Projects you might work on

When you’re not tackling difficult customer challenges, you’ll have a lot of freedom to work on things that will make your life, and the lives of our customers and Support Engineers, easier. Current and past support engineers have:

- created a tool to [quickly analyze strace output](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/strace-parser)
- built and maintained tooling to handle our call scheduling
- scripted a [solution to capture the state of a customer’s server](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/gitlabsos) for easier troubleshooting
- added functionality to [ChatOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/chatops/) to make it easier to identify user accounts on GitLab.com
- written a [Chrome Extension to route downloads from Zendesk tickets into organized folders](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/zd-dl-router)
- … [done even more](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox?sort=latest_activity_desc)!

### Why are GitLab Engineering Interns placed in Customer Support?

Products exist to serve customer needs, customer support exists for times when those needs aren't being met by the product or its documentation.

Develoing an empathy for and understanding of customer pain points is a career accelerator. No matter where you intend to go in your career, even outside of Engineering, getting [Results for Customers](/handbook/values/#results)
is at the core of why a company exists.

Support is uniquely positioned where decisions made by our colleagues in Sales, Customer Success, Product, Engineering and Documentation meet the customer. You'll have a chance to interact with team members across the business as you advocate for customer needs. More though: at GitLab, we're a step closer to our customers because we develop [publicly by default](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#public-by-default) and work hard to make it so that [everyone can contribute to the GitLab application](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/mission/#contribute-to-gitlab-application). This means that not only can you _report_ customer pain points: you can solve them.

Along the way you'll get exposure to the full suite of technologies our users use to build the world's software.

During an internship at GitLab:
- **Your public contributions will be a part of GitLab's history** - you'll [join the over 4000+ people who have helped co-create the leading DevOps Platform](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/)
- **You'll get exposure to modern software development practices** - you'll work directly with customers, and the engineering and product teams who support them to help leading companies deliver [software, faster.](https://about.gitlab.com/software-faster/)
- **Your efforts will have impact** - whether you work on public facing documentation or product improvements, or work on internally-focused tools for greater efficiency, you'll be working on real challenges that a [category-leading company](https://about.gitlab.com/gartner-magic-quadrant/) is faces
