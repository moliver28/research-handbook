As members of GitLab's [Security Operations department](/handbook/security/security-operations/), the [Security Operations](/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/) is divided into three focus areas: Security Incident Response, Trust & Safety, and Security Logging, and is operational 24/7 with a follow-the-sun rotation. The Security Operations (SecOps) team detects, manages, and remediates security incidents across GitLab. Members of SecOps are the defenders and firefighters of the GitLab Security division. SecOps works to create and maintain a safe and secure operating environment for the organization and its customers and responds to active security incidents. As a Security Engineer on SecOps you will build and maintain the tools we use to detect and respond to emerging threats in efficient and scalable ways, work to increase our observability over the organisation to catch threats early, respond to security incidents and drive them to resolution, and develop and deploy preventative security measures for the GitLab organization and GitLab.com. Successful Security Engineers thrive in high-stress environments and can think like both an attacker and defender, engage with and mentor more junior Security Engineers, and can help come up with proactive and preventative security measures to keep GitLab and its user's data safe in an ever changing threat landscape.

## Responsibilities

There are three functional responsibilities within the Security Operations team. 

### Security Incident Response

- Detect and respond to company-wide security incidents, coordinating cross-functional teams to mitigate and eradicate threats
- Monitor and analyze emerging threats, vulnerabilities and exploits
- Develop and implement scalable preventative security measures (detection, monitoring, exploitation)
- Incorporate current security trends, advisories, publications, and academic research
- Communicate risks and mitigations across multiple audiences

### Trust & Safety

- Monitor and mitigate abusive activity on GitLab.com
- Triage and respond to Trust and Safety related incidents and reports

- Be part of the architectural direction, administration, maintenance, documentation, and oversight of the Security information and event management ([SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management)) solution
- Create and maintain integrations and solutions for the log collection, aggregation, indexing, search, alerting
- Manage implementation, enhancement and adoption of the solutions built by the team into operations
- Utilize log ingestion platform for security analytics and identification of tactics, techniques and patterns of attackers
- Collect and review security logs from all systems (Cloud Providers, GitLab, OS, G-Suite, OKTA, IDS, etc.)
- Adequately forecast capacity, cost and log volumes. Ensure log volume and costs remain within budget and avoid overages, communicating capacity risks with plenty of time to plan for financial forecasting.
- Ensure compliance with internal policies, standards, and regulatory requirements
