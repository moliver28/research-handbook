## The GitLab Top 15 Workplace Practices: How we work together in an all-remote workplace

This list is designed for all team members to orient themselves to the most important and impactful practices that enable the GitLab team to achieve results every day. Having shared ways of work increases efficiency and collaboration. All team members are expected to adopt these ways of working.

From this page, you can quickly navigate through the GitLab handbook and Level Up to learn more about why and how each practice comes to life in our day to day flow of work.


## GitLab Top 15

### How we treat each other

##### 1: [Be respectful of others' time](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#be-respectful-of-others-time) and working hours - it’s 5 o'clock somewhere!

##### 2: Feel [safe](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/) to make mistakes, we all do it. They’re an opportunity for learning, so take a [bias for action](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#bias-for-action) as you [iterate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration).

##### 3: You aren’t going to bump into each other in the corridor, so make time to [build meaningful connections](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#informal-communication) with coffee chats and social Slack channels.

### How we collaborate

##### 4: Communicate [async-first](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#asynchronous-communication),...

##### 5: ...but don’t underestimate [sync conversation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#effective--responsible-communication-guidelines). In some cases, a 1:1 Zoom call is more efficient.

##### 6: Start with the handbook, end with the handbook - we are [handbook first](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first/)!

##### 7: [Debate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#disagree-commit-and-disagree) can lead to greater results. Talk things out and explore actions and risks collaboratively and respectfully. [Seek diverse perspectives](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#seek-diverse-perspectives) for debate and feedback. There’s going to be disagreements, but that doesn’t mean we have to fall out.

##### 8: It helps to have someone calling the shots. Assign a [Directly Responsible Individual](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#empowering-dris) (DRI), then empower them to [make decisions](https://handbook.gitlab.com/teamops/decision-velocity).

##### 9: Don’t be afraid to overshare (at least when it comes to work) - remember to use [low-context communication](https://handbook.gitlab.com/teamops/decision-velocity/#low-context-communication).

##### 10: [Manage your own attention](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/). Need time to focus? Let people know with a calendar block and Slack status. Meeting topics not relevant to your work? Leave the meeting or work on something else.

### How we work async-first

##### 11: It’s hard, but [avoid direct messages](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages). Instead, use public and private channels. It’s more transparent and more efficient to add new people to the conversation.

##### 12: Stay organized by using [Slack](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#general-guidelines) threads to respond to questions. When the thread gets too long, open a GitLab issue! Messages in Slack are only retained for 90 days, so use issues to plan and make decisions.

### How we sync

##### 13: Every [meeting](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/) needs an agenda. Schedule meetings using Google Speedy Meetings and always start an agenda using the Google Docs template.

##### 14: Everyone contributes to [note taking](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#smart-note-taking-in-meetings), so don’t be afraid to jump in and give it a try!

##### 15: Time is precious, so [limit presentations during meetings](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#few-meetings-with-presentations). Spend more time discussing, debating, and reflecting.
