## **What is CSAT?**

Customer Satisfaction is a qualitative metric to ascertain a deeper understanding of the customer sentiment at a point in the life cycle. **Customer Satisfaction score**, or **CSAT,** is a transactional attribute to understand how a specific action, product, or experience in the customer lifecycle has gone.

* **Note**: Any type of question or questions can be a CSAT survey. There are **no standards for questions or metrics**. It is entirely based on what GitLab is trying to learn about the customer from a question.

**GitLab utilizes two primary types of CSAT surveys:**

* **Product CSAT:** Administered by the product team via Qualtrics to a smaller group of users, these surveys focus on measuring satisfaction with specific GitLab features and functionalities.  
* **Service CSAT:** Administered by the Customer Success team via Gainsight to a larger audience, these surveys assess customer satisfaction with GitLab's overall support, service levels, and customer experience.

Both teams are working collaboratively to streamline the survey process, improve data collection efficiency, and ensure that we have a comprehensive understanding of customer feedback. [OKR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/9025).

## **Active GitLab CSAT Surveys**

* Digital SMB [Case Closure Survey](/handbook/sales/commercial/global_digital_smb/#email-to-case) CSAT Survey  
* Product CSAT Survey

## **Customer Engagement**

### **Who do we contact?**

CSAT surveys sent directly to primary users on paid Premium and Ultimate accounts to measure satisfaction of a service, product, interaction or experience with GitLab. Each account will receive a CSAT survey no more than twice in a year. We hope to receive from as many accounts at GitLab as possible, rather than a representative sample of accounts. This enables us to inform all account teams of their portfolioâ€™s customer satisfaction.

In order to target leaders and decision-makers on accounts, three types of users will receive an invitation to a survey:

* [GitLab admin contacts](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/customer-success-operations/cs-ops-programs/#gitlab-admin-contacts)  
* Sold-To Billing Contact (if no GitLab Admin exists)  
* [GitLab.com Owner user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)

### **Who is not contacted on a CSAT survey?**

* Identified Billing or Procurement personas configured as Owners or GitLab Admins on accounts  
* Guest, Reporter, Developer or Maintainer roles on accounts  
* Users that have been contacted by others CSAT Surveys within the past eight weeks, such as the [Product CSAT](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/csat/) survey administered by the UX Research Team.

## **Viewing CSAT Survey Results**

Each CSAT is owned by different teams. Please see the child pages above for links to dashboards. 

## **Deprecated Surveys**

### **\[DEPRECATED\] Net Promoter Score Survey (NPS)**

**What is NPS?** 

Net Promoter Score is a [standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score) numerical value from 1 to 10\. It is NOT a determination of customer health. It is NOT a method of pinpointing specific product issues.

Customers received NPS surveys at multiple points in their lifecycle from 2021 to 2024\. These are stopped as of May 1, 2024\. Their results and data can be accessed [by request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/customer-success-operations/-/issues/new) to the CSSO team. Additionally, you may request historical data for the following NPS surveys:

* Post-Onboarding NPS/CSAT  
* Pre-Renewal NPS  
* Post-Renewal NPS/CSAT
