### Objectives

The purpose of this page is to provide clear guidelines around GitLab's FY25 GTM Rules of Engagement in the following areas:

1. Account Ownership
2. Opportunity Ownership
3. Opportunity Order Type

**For more information on terms and other sales information, please visit GitLab's [Go to Market](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/) page.**


### Account Ownership Rules of Engagement

**Effective FY25-Q1**

**NOTE: Working a Lead, Contact, Opportunity or Account does not ensure ownership. Before investing any effort, it is the responsibility of the sales rep to confirm that an account listed as owned by them in SFDC is in fact in their territory.**

SFDC topics of  “Embargoed Country” and “Visual Compliance Checks” will also be flagged on the account.
    - The Restricted Account Field will be populated with a status of “Restricted Party”


### Understanding Account Assignment, Rules and Definitions

#### Source of Data

The data sources used to properly segment and route an account are defined and explained in the [Account Demographics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UaKPTQePAU1RxtGSVb-BujdKiPVoepevrRh8q5bvbBg/edit#bookmark=id.thpuid9gpo74) section of the handbook. If the data tools have failed to provide employee count and/or address information, the account segment and/or territory will remain Unknown until resolved through manual research and a link to a reputable data is provided to the Sales Operations team to confirm. Follow the process to request changes to the Account Demographics inputs if the account information is missing or wrong. If the employee count is unknown or blank and manual research cannot confirm, Sales Operations will mark the account as SMB with a placeholder of -1 employees in order to get a Territory to populate and assign the account to an account rep. Any disputes must follow the exception process below.

#### Qualifying Accounts

- Account Executives (AE) are responsible for validating that accounts assigned to them in SFDC are accurately segmented. A reasonable effort should be made to check employee count, Account hierarchy, and Headquarters location.



#### Account Ownership:

Only active Field Sales (AE and Partner Manager) members can own accounts.  The exceptions to this rule include:
1. Field Sales Management temporarily covering an account
     - Field Sales Management cannot own an account for more than 30 days.  After 30 days, they must transfer the account and associated open opportunities to an active AE for temporary ownership. Exceptions to extend Field Sales Management ownership of an account beyond 30 days must be approved by his/her Sales VP and the Sr. Director of GTM Planning & Operations. 
1. Sales Admin, PubSec Queue or Impartner Integration - ownership is temporary while our data enrichment tools or manual review by Sales Operations determine the correct Sales member
1. Non-Sales members who own "test" or "junk" accounts

Account ownership will be determined by the Sales Segment and Address of the Ultimate Parent Account.  All children accounts in a hierarchy will be owned by the Global Account Owner of the Corporate Hierarchy regardless of physical location unless the child account has been identified as a Major Account, Named Account, India Capability Center, part of a split Hierarchy/locally managed or Holding Company 


### Intra Year Account Ownership Policy
**The following policy applies to account ownership in the middle of the Fiscal year:**

1. **Feb 1st Confirmed Segment** applies to when an Account is accurately aligned to the correct segment and owner at the beginning of the fiscal year based on employee count. During the year, if there is an increase or decrease to employee count, the Account will NOT be moved to a new segment or owner until the subsequent year.
    1.  Accounts that are eligible for immediate transfer include:
        - Non-data enriched identified bad/inaccurate data (cases
        - Mergers or Acquisitions
        - Standalone child accounts
        - Public Sector or SAFE visibility concerns
        - Territory re-carves
        - JiHu accounts
    2. Upon Sales' discovery of inaccurate data, M&A activity or standalone child accounts resulting in incorrect assignment, the **AE must obtain agreement from all impacted ASMs** before partnering with Sales Support to immediately transfer the Account and open opportunities to the correct AE.
    3. In the event an Account has been transferred due to one of the eligible scenarios above, Closed Opportunities that result in a churn or contraction within 90 days (prior or following) of an account transfer will remain with the existing Account Executive. Review of churn/contraction ownership must be raised by a member of the account team via chatter within the 90 day grace period for consideration.
    4. Data Enrichment Corrections - in scenarios where one of our data enrichment providers identify inaccurate account data:
         - The data will be corrected on the account but ownership will not reroute until the following fiscal year.


     **When does this policy apply?**
     1. FY25 move if accounts meet the criteria to move immediately
     2. FY26 move if organic growth warrants an Account to move segments/owners.
     3. Applies to ENT Named and Major Accounts; Excludes MM Named Accounts.

    **Use Case(s):**

    1. Sales identifies that the employee count data was inaccurate and the Account should align to a new segment, reassigned in FY25.
    2. ZoomInfo enriched the Account and the employee count increased and now it aligns to the Enterprise segment. No change to account assignment in FY25, but it will be reassigned to the correct segment in FY26.
    3. Data was accurate for the Feb 1st Confirmed Segment and the number of employees changes (up or down), and the Account is stale (no documented activity). The Account moves in FY26.

**Important Notes**
- Non-compliance to this policy goes against the GitLab values and it will be up to the AE Leadership Team's discretion as to applicable disciplinary action.
- If an Account is identified as incorrectly assigned to you, regardless of whether you know someone in the Account, the AE should not engage in any capacity and instead partner with Sales Support to immediately transfer the Account and open or improperly closed won opportunity ownership to the correct AE. The transferring AE is expected to take this action and actively communicate in a manner that optimizes the prospect/customer experience.
- In the event an AE unknowingly engages with an Account that is not theirs, they should log SFDC activity and notify the correct Account owner. If there is no collaboration initiated with the correct Account owner, your actions will be reviewed by your segment and regional leadership team.
- AEs are not permitted to sell into accounts they do not own in SFDC.

#### Parent/Child Segmentation:

All Accounts in a hierarchy will adopt the MAX Segmentation of any account in the hierarchy. In other words, the sum of all of the employees within a hierarchy will be the total hierarchy employee count, of which the segment will be based off of. Expanded definitions and examples can be found in the handbook’s [Sales Terminology Definitions](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-glossary/#parent-and-child-accounts).

#### Named Account

An account that is owned by an AE with a headquarters outside of his or her designated geographical territory. Named accounts are identified by the Named Account Checkbox on the Account. Named Accounts are owned and worked by the designated AE along with all records (LEADS and CONTACTS) associated with that Named Account and any related Child accounts within or added to SFDC. Upon discovery of data inaccuracies in Named accounts, sales-support should be engaged to review the data and move the account, if applicable, following the February 1st Confirmed Segment policy.

#### Major Account

An account that is owned by a Major Account Executive, this account can be headquarters outside of his or her designated geographical territory. Major accounts will be reviewed annually to determine if any ownership changes are required. Upon discovery of data inaccuracies in Major accounts, sales-support should be engaged to review the data and move the account, if applicable, following the February 1st Confirmed Segment policy.

#### Disqualified Account
An account that is in the “disqualified” territory will be owned by Sales Ops Admin and excluded from Territory Planning. A disqualified account is defined as an account that our data enrichment providers have noted as being “out of business” and which we do not have any open opportunities with. Upon discovery of data inaccuracies in Disqualified Accounts, sales-support should be engaged to review the data and move the account, if applicable, following the February 1st Confirmed Segment policy.


#### Public Sector Account:

An account that is identified as Public Sector Worldwide. Once identified, the assignment of these accounts will be according to the Government Rules of Engagement.

#### Commercial Accounts:

Mid-Market accounts are covered by three Sales motions: First Order (New Business) accounts, Named accounts, and Territory accounts:
- **First Order Accounts:** Targeted high-potential prospect accounts, assigned to First Order Account Executives until the initial transaction is closed.
- **Named Accounts:** High potential accounts with an active subscription, that we're looking to expand with dedicated sales resources. These accounts are nominated through both quantitative & qualitative analysis in Annual Planning for their growth potential. In addition, all `First Order` accounts will be passed over as a `Named Account` once an initial deal is closed won. It's important this transition occurs in a timely manner after initial deal closure, to start business expansion efforts ASAP.
- **Territory Accounts:** All remaining Mid-Market accounts are considered Territory Accounts and will be worked by the Territory AE.

#### Override Hierarchy Routing:

An account that is owned by a local account rep regardless of the Global Account Leader. We must have agreement from both ASMs via SFDC Chatter in order to move an account to a different owner than the Global Account rep. Split hierarchies will be reviewed annually to determine if they should be moved to the Global Account Rep at that time.

- **Considerations for transferring an account to a local rep:** If the decision-making power, end users, PO and Terms (or a majority combination) are confined to the child account, the Ultimate Parent owner should hand off the account to the appropriate territory owner as this would be in the best interests of the customer and for GitLab. Follow the Exception Process to request Account Ownership Change.


#### Stand-alone Child Account:

**Definition**: Standalone child accounts are generally defined as accounts that have their own buying authority and purchasing process.  Please see the account types below for specifics.

**Salesforce Alignment**:  Standalone child accounts will not be parented.  Segmentation and ownership will be based on the Account Demographics of the standalone account.  Additionally, the corresponding number of employees of the standalone account will not count towards the HQ total employee count. 


1. **Holding Company** 
     - **Definition**:  Accounts where the governing entity is a Holding Company. A holding company is a business entity that doesn’t manufacture anything, sell any products or services, or conduct any other business operations. Rather, holding companies hold the controlling stock in other companies (subsidiaries) and often maintain only oversight capacities. So while it may oversee  management decisions, it does not actively participate in running  the day-to-day business operations of these subsidiaries.
      - **Salesforce Alignment**: These accounts ey will not be parented and will include the name of the holding company in the `Holding Company Name` field. Ownership & segmentation will be based on the individual account attributes and NOT the Holding Company attributes.
2. **Private Equity**: An investment management company that provides financial backing and makes investments in the private equity of startup or operating companies through a variety of loosely affiliated investment strategies including leveraged buyout, venture capital, and growth capital.
3. **Joint Venture**: A business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared governance, and shared risks and returns.
4. **Independent Franchise**: A business whereby the owner (Franchisor) licenses its operations to the Franchisee, along with its products, branding, and knowledge, in exchange for a franchise fee. The license allows the Franchisee to sell the products under the Franchisor’s business name. 
5. **Government Holding Entity - Child Accounts:**: Public Sector accounts are identified by the Public Sector Account Checkbox on the Account. Once identified, ownership would be determined by the country alignment below. The definition of a PubSec account is the same for United States Public Sector and Rest of World Public Sector.
    1. **United States:** [GitLab Public Sector Rules of Engagement Handbook Page](/handbook/sales/public-sector/)
    2. **Rest of World:** [ROW Public Sector Rules of Engagement Handbook Page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GR8fFQQhaGlH18quMkbEbY1gIvj0_4-LVRxdHpuZW20/edit#heading=h.kk8kup16ppw8)
        1. **APAC:** All countries covered by Enterprise.
        2. **EMEA:** All countries covered by Enterprise.
        3. **AMER:** All countries covered by Enterprise.


#### Mergers & Acquisitions

In the event that there are changes to an organization or hierarchy as a result of a Merger or Acquisition, account ownership will transfer immediately upon agreement between the impacted ASMs. The official date of the merger or acquisition does not influence the account transfer date.

**Acceptable sources to validate M&A activity:**
1. Official announcement via the acquiring or acquired organization's public website
2. Official public recording/filing (ie. annual report, SEC filing, etc)
3. Email confirmation from the customer stating the occurrence and timing of the acquisition

**NOTE**: An “intent” to acquire does not warrant an account reparenting or ownership transfer.  The merger or acquisition MUST be formally completed and communicated before requesting review. 


#### Net New Accounts

Please review the [Account Creation Policy](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/data-intelligence/governance/_governance/#account-creation-policy) for details on the account creation process and data enrichment on net new accounts. 

**Sales Admin Owned Accounts**: When new accounts are created due to web portal purchases, they are enriched by ZoomInfo (if a match is found), temporarily assigned to the Sales Admin User, and are changed to the correct (and active) Sales User in the following cadences:
- For accounts with known attributes (employees and location) based on the data enrichment, that are FO available, and have $0 Net ARRR, the account gets routed to the automatically assigned territory owner via data load on Mondays. Note: This cannot be automated for compliance reasons.
- For accounts without known attributes (employees and location not identified), the account is manually reviewed by Sales Operations weekly on Mondays and assigned to the correct owner.
- If Data Intelligence is unable to identify enough attributes to correctly assign the account,  we will default to the billing account information and allocated to the SMB territory and account owner.

All Restricted Accounts will remain in Sales Admin and be assigned to the Restricted Accounts territory per RoE for Banned Countries following review by legal.

#### Community Programs (OSS/EDU/Startups) Accounts

For Accounts where there's an OSS/EDU/Startups opportunity, ownership of that Account will remain with the active Field Sales (AE/SAE) member. However, the relevant Community Program DRI will manage the OSS/EDU/Startups relationship and will be identified in a separate field on the Account called Community Program Owner.

#### Requesting Account Data Review or Revisions

Account data review requests are managed via Salesforce cases by the Data Intelligence team.  Submit your requests by chattering @sales-support on the related Account.  Please be specific and comprehensive in your ask to ensure timeliness of actioning the request.


#### Annual Account  Review Process

Accounts will be reviewed annually prior to the Fiscal Year planning process and territory carving.

#### JiHu <> GitLab RoE and Referral Guidelines

The purpose of this section is to provide clarity to the GitLab & JiHu (GitLab China) Rules of Engagement and Referral Rules. Please reference the [GitLab <> JiHu Engagement and Referral Rules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PlokO-GzxEHRu0rwNwf4HUPSF7QVd16N/view) for additional details.

**Criteria that determines JiHu account ownership:**

If an Account meets the following definition of a PRC (People’s Republic of China) Customer then it is owned by JiHu:
1. Persons (excluding natural persons) falling under the following definition (as set forth in the Investment Agreement) will be PRC Customers: An entity whose Ultimate Parent is incorporated in the Territory (which consists of the PRC, Hong Kong and Macau, and for the purposes of these Rules excludes Taiwan) OR an entity under the ultimate Control of an individual with PRC nationality (which, for the purposes of this definition, includes HKSAR and Macau)
2. Seeks to deploy Licensed Applications in the Territory only;
3. Requests for invoices to be sent to a billing address located within the Territory; and
4. Is not a MIT User.

**Disputes & Escalations process:**

GitLab Sales Operations and JiHu Sales Operations meet on a bi-weekly basis to review account disputes and based on the RoE make a determination if the account is GitLab or JiHu owned. GitLab Sales Operations and JiHu Sales Operations also have related discussions as needed in a slack channel on the JiHu slack workspace called #roe-case-discussion. GitLab Sales Operations and JiHu Sales Operations maintain a log of all escalated cases in a Google Sheet. 

JiHu escalates an account to GitLab by logging it in the Google Sheet. It must be raised within 10 business days of discovery of possible ownership discrepancy.  The escalation should include at a minimum the following details and other relevant information: 
Escalation details:
1. Date of escalation
     - Duration of receiving feedback
     - Date of handover
     - Status
     - Account ownership outcome
2. Account Information:
     - Billing address
     - Ultimate Parent address
3. Opportunity Information:
     - License type (Self-Managed vs SaaS; Premium vs Ultimate)
     - Number of users
     - Estimate USD
     - User location
     - JiHu opportunity stage
     - JiHu sales rep name
     - Renewal date (if applicable)
4. Additional relevant information:
     - Chinese regulatory requirements
     - Customer’s preferred reseller required or direct
     - Payment term in local currency
     - Local support requirements
     - Migration support resource Chinese fluency requirement

GitLab Sales Operations reviews the RoE case to determine Account ownership based on the definition of PRC as described above and responds within 3 business days of escalation. GitLab Sales Operations may ask JiHu Sales Operations to provide additional information and an additional 3 business days will apply for resolution.

If an Account is deemed it should be owned by GitLab, the following process applies:
1. GitLab Sales Operations provides JiHu with the GitLab account owner name and email address within 2 business days.
2. The JiHu rep sends an email to the customer introducing the GitLab sales rep; copies the GitLab sales rep and GitLab Sales Operations on the email.
3. The GitLab sales rep should immediately take ownership and connect with the customer to support their sales transaction.
4. The GitLab sales rep should proceed with requesting the Account be created in the GitLab SFDC instance.
5. Once the Account is created, the GitLab sales rep should proceed with creating the opportunity and adhering to the sales process.

If the Account is owned by GitLab but the GitLab rep determines or JiHu conveys that one or more of the following customer requirements applies which are not currently supported by GitLab (valid as of 2023-11-30, subject to change), 
1. SaaS vs Self-Managed (SaaS is not offered in China)
2. Chinese regulatory requirements
3. Customers preferred reseller needed/ or direct 
4. Payment term in RMB
5. In-country and local language support requirement 
6. Migration support resource fluent in Chinese
7. Sales resource fluent in Chinese
8. Product features required for China only (integration with DingDing, Feishu, etc.)

then the following **JiHu Exception Approval Process applies**:  

1. GitLab Sales Rep slacks in the @jihu-account-escalations channel the request to obtain exception approval and provides the Account name and business justification.
2. GitLab Sales Operations creates the Issue and includes the pertinent background information and the business justification for the exception approval request.
3. The CRO and applicable AVP/VP and ASM are tagged in the Issue for review and approval.
4. Once the JiHu exception approval is granted in the Issue, GitLab Sales Operations communicates to JiHu approval was given to proceed with engaging the customer to support their sales transaction. 

**Multinational companies (MNC) with headquarters outside of China and affiliates in China, or Multinational companies (MNC) with headquarters in China and affiliates outside of China, seeking a shared instance concept**:

1. They are considered as GitLab accounts. It is the MNCs’ responsibility to comply with PIPL and the GitLab Subscription Agreement Section 14.4 if there are users in China to be part of the namespace and/or if there are user data crossing borders.
2. GitLab Self-Managed licenses are recommended for these MNCs if they are seeking shared instance, with the MNC headquarters being the purchasing entities. 
3. GitLab SaaS cannot be sold to any China affiliate directly. GitLab SaaS can only be sold to entities located outside of China.
4. GitLab Dedicated follows GitLab SaaS rules for PIPL consideration
5. When in doubt, slack in the @jihu-account-escalations channel

**Novation of an Account:**
1. If a current customer of GitLab Inc or its Affiliates who falls within the definition of a PRC Customer, or a current PRC Customer (JiHu customer) falls outside the definition, then:
     - The affected entity must obtain agreements from the customer to approve the novation to the other party of that customer’s existing customer contracts with the affected party;
     - If an existing customer refuses to be novated at that time, then at the time of renewal of such customer’s agreement, the affected party will refuse to renew the contract.
2. The affected party will provide an Exception Notice to the other party within 10 business days of knowledge of such change and will continue to service the account until the customer account is fully transferred to the other party to ensure that the customer has continuity of support until expiry of the then current term of that customer’s existing contract.  





### Opportunity Ownership Rules of Engagement

**Understanding Opportunity Assignment, Rules and Definitions**

1. **Opportunity Ownership:**
    1. Only active Field Sales (AE/SAE) members can own opportunities. The exceptions to this rule include:
        1. **Community Program opportunities** (primarily $0 EDU/OSS): which will be owned by a member of that team.
           - For scenarios where there's a paid opportunity **and** a free EDU opportunity, the AE owns the relationship. If there is not a paid opportunity closed-won or any open paid opportunity (pre-closed-won) then the appropriate Commumity Programs team member manages the relationship.
        1. **Reseller opportunities**: which can be owned by the AE or channel manager
            - For scenarios where there's a paid opportunity **and** a free EDU opportunity, the AE/SAE owns the relationship. If there is not a paid opportunity closed-won or any open paid opportunity (pre-closed-won) then the appropriate Commumity Programs team member manages the relationship.
        1. **Reseller opportunities**: which can be owned by the AE/SAE or channel manager:

        1. The opportunity owner should match the corresponding Account owner.  The exceptions to this rule are:
        1. Those noted in the aforementioned section
        1. Holdover opportunities
        1. When an Renewals Manager or SDR has created an opportunity but has not yet transitioned it to the correct AE/SAE
        1. Stage of the opportunity at time of account ownership change
        1. [GSI or MSP opportunties](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-msp-opportunities), where the end user is different to whom gets the license. In this case, the opportunity will be assigned to the owner of the end user account.
1. **Sales Admin Owned Opportunities:** When new opportunities are created due to web portal purchases, they are temporarily assigned to the Sales Admin User and are changed to the correct (and active) Sales User in the following cadences:
    - For accounts with known attributes (employees and location), the account gets routed to the correct owner via the Account Demographics process.  Twice weekly Sales Operations reviews the corresponding opportunity and updates the Opportunity owner to match the Account owner (unless exceptions apply).
    - For accounts without known attributes (employees and location not identified), the account and corresponding opportunity are manually reviewed by Sales Operations twice weekly and assigned to the correct owners.
        - If Sales Operations is unable to identify enough attributes to correctly assign the account or opportunity, they will remain in Sales Admin owned and allocated to SMB for crediting.

### Holdover Opportunities

#### Guiding Principles of the Policy:

1. **Preserve necessary business momentum** - holdovers primarily exist to preserve momentum on key deals in flight, thus mitigating the pipeline impact of GTM related business disruption.
1. **Align incentives**
     - The secondary purpose of holdovers is to give individual contributor Account Owners (AEs and SAEs) an opportunity to be compensated on labor-intensive deals that are near closure at the time an account is transitioned
     - However, holdovers delay account transition and the formation of new pipeline by the new account owner because new account owners are not paid on holdover net ARR.
1. **Minimize holdover volume** - volume should be minimized to the most impactful and mature deals in flight at the time of account transition
1. Stage based criteria is not applicable for opportunities moving out of the Commercial segment. Stage criteria does not apply to holdovers for Commercial because Commercial leadership does not want this criteria to artificially inflate the value of the pipeline. Holdovers should be selected wisely as there will be no extensions to the holdover timeline.


#### Opportunity Holdover Criteria

The following criteria make a deal eligible for a holdover:

#### Annual Review Holdovers

**Enterprise**
1. Deal size (Net ARR) is > $50K for Growth and > $5K for New Logo. Amount is >$5K for PS Only opportunities
1. The deal is in stage 3+
1. Close date must be within 90 days prior to holdover expiration date
1. Requires evidence of engagement in the 30 days prior to announcement of the change
1. Deals that meet this criteria are given a maximum 90 day holdover expiration period. If the deal does not close in 90 days it will be moved to the current account owner.

**Commercial**
1. All opportunities that are **moving to Enterprise** that meet the Enterprise holdover policy thresholds (these opps are identified and flagged by Sales Operations)
     - Deals that meet this criteria are given a 90 day holdover expiration period. If the deal does not close in 90 days it will be moved to the current account owner.
1. For opportunities that are **moving within Commercial**, each affected Account Executive can hold over 2 opportunities.
     - Opportunities will be discussed during AE/ASM 1:1’s and a final list will be shared with Sales Operations to be updated in SFDC.
     - Deals that meet this criteria are given a 30 day holdover expiration period. If the deal does not close in 30 days it will be moved to the current account owner.


#### Additional Guidelines:

- **Sell What You See Period** The interim period between the end of FY23 and when accounts have been aligned to FY24 owners in SFDC (2023-02-08)
     - In this scenario, whoever closes the opportunity & his/her corresponding management will get paid (even if it’s going to a different owner)
- **Documented Account Strategy**  The team who is giving up/losing the account and/or opportunity must work with the new owner on a transition plan to ensure there’s no disruption to current sales cycles or customer/prospect experience.
     - The Account handover checklist: Enterprise Sales can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bhGuzTZxnq70ob-3fxHVhu7LYObcrrFMev0697fDDks/edit)
- **For cross segment holdovers**, the governing rules are dictated by the team that is receiving the account and/or opportunity.   For example, an existing Mid Market opportunity that would be going to an Enterprise AE/ASM would have a 90 day holdover period to close before it would be moved to the receiving Enterprise owner.
- **Holdovers apply to both the giving AE/ASM and receiving AE/ASM in all Segments** to promote teamwork and alignment. During the 90 day holdover period, the bookings, New Logo (when applicable) & commissions credit will be allocated as follows:
    1. Month 1: 100% to the "Giving AE/ASM" and 0% to the "Receiving AE/ASM",
    1. Month 2: 75% to the "Giving AE/ASM" and 25% to the "Receiving AE/ASM",
    1. Month 3: 50% to the "Giving AE/ASM" and 50% to the "Receiving AE/ASM"

Within a Region under one ASM (or acting ASM), it is the ASM's responsibility to obtain and document agreement in chatter between the two AEs in that region.

Within a Geo under one Sales VP, it is the Sales VP's responsibility to obtain agreement between the two ASMs in that Geo and document in chatter.


- **Sales Leaders** are responsible for ensuring that holdover opportunities align with the guiding principles of this policy. Leadership ensures that opportunities are not moved prematurely to stage 3.
- Holdovers do not apply to TAMs or SAs.
- Holdovers do not apply to Renewals Managers.
- Holdover opportunities are flagged in SFDC using the`Holdover Expiration Date` fields on the Opportunity and are monitored on the [Sales Ops: ROE Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYC7).
- Credit will be given to the AE on the holdover opportunity if it closes before the expiration date.


### Opportunity Order Type Rules of Engagement

**Understanding Order Type Assignment, Rules and Definitions**

**Source of Data:** The account attributes used to properly assign Order Type are defined and explained in the [Sales Term Glossary](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#customer-definitions-for-external-reporting) section of the handbook.

**Common Manual Override Scenarios:** Although Order Type is generated automatically on an opportunity, there are common scenarios in which it could require updating via a manual override:
- [Customers Returning More Than 180 Days After Subscription Term End Date](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunity-requirements-for-returning-customers)
- Refunds
- Incorrect Parenting/Hierarchies

**Process to Request Order Type Changes:**  In the event that Order Type needs to be changed, please chatter @sales-support on the opportunity with details as to why the change is being requested.  This will trigger a case, which will be reviewed by the Sales Operations and Deal Desk teams.

 **Best Practices**
1. Before moving an SDR Account or non-Sales owned account check for duplicate accounts in the system. If a duplicate is found, merge the records.
1. Before moving an SDR Account or non-Sales owned account check if the account is a child account and needs to be parented. If so, parent the account and assign to the owner of the parent account.

 **Case Review Process**
 1. When a case is received, review to see if consensus has been met by all parties and if the supporting documentation is included in the chatter feed
 1. Update any of the data on the account if needed to reflect what was provided
 1. Determine if the request meets any of the criteria for an immediate move.
    1. Immediate move - Move the account to the new owner. Move any open opportunties stages 0-2 to the new owner. Opportunities stages 3-6 follow holdover policy above and where applicable mark the `Holdover Expiration Date` for 90 days from date of approval on the Opportunity.
    1. If the account does not meet the criteria for an immediate move, select the Picklist Value of `Quarterly Review` in the `Account Reassignment Status` field so the account will show up on the [Sales Operations Quarterly Account Review Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYC7)
 1. Close the case and indicate in chatter that this will be reviewed and if approved by Sales Operations when they can expect the account ownership to transfer

 **Quarterly Account Review Process**
1. Use the reports on the [Sales Operations Quarterly Account Review Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYC7) to review the requested account moves.
   1. Prospect and Customer accounts will need to be evaluated to ensure the move doesn't impact quota. Once approved to be moved: move any open opportunties stages 0-3 to the new owner. Opportunities stages 4-6 mark the `Holdover Expiration Date` for 90 days from date of approval on the Opportunity.
   1. Once account ownership has been updated remove the `Quarterly Review` picklist value from the `Account Reassignment Status`

**Holdover Account and Opportunity Review Process**
1. Review the [Account & Opportunity Holdover Expiration reports](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYC7) and move the expired accounts and opportunities to the current `Account Owner` and remove the date from the field.
1. Remove the value from the `Holdover Expiration Date` after transfer of ownership (Note that this cannot be removed from accounts past stage 6)
1. Accounts are not eligible for a second holdover request. If this request is made the ASMs must agree and must be approved by Sales Operations Leadership

**Annual Review Process**
1. Ensure these requests are reviewed and approved as part of the annual territory planning process. Utilize the dashboard to capture all requests from Q3 & Q4 to be moved at the beginning of Q1

**Order Type Review**
- Validate that the requestor has provided adequate details to justify the change request.
- Follow the below steps for each Common Manual Override Scenarios:
    1. **Customers Returning More than 180  Days After Subscription Term End Date:** Review the subscription term end date from the existing subscription.  If it is > 180 days, the opportunity Order Type should be manually updated to  First Order or New Connected.
    1. **Refunds:** Confirm with deal desk that the opportunity is, in fact, a refund.  If yes, the opportunity Order Type should be manually updated to  First Order or New Connected.
    1. **Incorrect Parenting/Hierarchy:** Validate that the parenting is, in fact, incorrect.  If so, unparent the account(s) and manually update the opportunity Order Type to First Order or New Connected


**Sales Admin Owned Review and Owner Change Process**

Steps to add AE names to open/closed opps owned by Sales Admin (Easy Fixes)

1. Export the easy fix reports from [this dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYRM)
1. To work from google sheet: Copy Values and paste into google spreadsheet, or you can use Excel
1. Match the opportunity owner to the current account owner
    - **EXCEPTION**: For existing accounts where the OSS/EDU Assigned field is populated AND the Web direct opportunity is $0 Net ARR, the opportunity owner should be the person in the OSS/EDU Assigned field
1. To prepare the upload, you will only need the following fields: Opportunity Owner ID, Opportunity ID, SA Team, Account Owner (O), Owner Team (O) (you also need to update the Account ID/ Account Owner ID but I recommend uploading the accounts on a separate worksheet to avoid confusion.)
1. Save the file as CSV and upload to data loader.
1. To update the account owner you will need Account ID, Account Owner ID. Match the opp owner to the Account Owner and upload.
1. The opportunities update in smaller increments (my cutline was 20). Split the upload sheet in 20’s as necessary and upload.

Steps to add AE’s to Closed Opps and accounts owned by Sales Admin (Hard Fixes)

1. Export the hard fix reports from [this dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYRM)
1. To work from google sheet: Copy Values and paste into google spreadsheet, or you can use Excel
1. Add filters onto the sheet to organize the sheet in alphabetical order
1. Sort the “Billing Country” field A → Z, this way you can populate multiple owners if the opps have the same billing country
1. It is easier to work by market segment, filter by SMB/MM/Large/PubSec (choose a field from Account Owner Team, Owner Team, SA Team - it is usually just best to choose the field with more values since many opportunities have missing fields)
1. Use [this mapping file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n3_JQULEzHjwlrSQcchxnFiSLVD698yxF4k-M6OtQ2E/edit#gid=950930175) to look for corresponding AE’s
1. Insert 2 rows on the sheet and add Owner Name and Owner ID (you will delete the name later in prior to uploading- but is there for your view)
1. After inputting the names and Owner ID’s there will be multiple opps that do not have Billing countries listed on the Account. There are many times in which have Account Demographic Country fields populated, but not the Billing Country or vice versa. Use those fields to map and populate the corresponding AE’s.
1. If there is a zip code but no countries listed, it is recommended that you use google search to populate the States/countries to find the corresponding AE’s.
1. If the opportunity is missing a market segment, try to do a quick google search on the company. If no information is found, it is likely that the account is SMB.
1. Populate the Account owner (O), Owner Team (O), and SA Team and match as information above, and table.
1. Repeat this process for each Market Segment (SMB/MM/Large/PubSec) making sure each Territory is correct
1. Make sure all opportunities are populated. If you cannot find any information on the account, make sure to ask about those before uploading.
1. To prepare the upload, you will only need the following fields: Opportunity Owner ID, Opportunity ID, SA Team, Account Owner (O), Owner Team (O) (you also need to update the Account ID/ Account Owner ID but I recommend uploading the accounts on a separate worksheet to avoid confusion.)
1. Save the file as CSV and upload to data loader.
1. To update the account owner you will need Account ID, Account Owner ID. Match the opp owner to the Account Owner and upload.

If the opportunity is in a closed period, the Manager, Renewals and Sales Comp need to approve having the Renewals Manager added to the opportunity before tagging Jesse Rabbits directly to make the update.
    - Note: Only James Harrison or Jesse Rabbits can update closed opportunities at this time.

**Warning:** Updating these tables without updating Operations will not be reflected in our various systems causing all reports and routing to be incorrect!
