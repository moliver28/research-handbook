## Leave Policy

### Annual Leave

Team members with a 5 day working week are entitled to a minimum of 12 working days of annual leave during their first five years of service. This entitlement increases to 17 working days from the sixth year up to the ninth year, and thereafter, to a maximum of 23 working days.

Annual leave payment is calculated at the regular salary pay rate.

### Sick Leave

### Maternity Leave

Team members are entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave following the completion of one year of service within the company. The team member may take up to seven weeks of leave before the predicted due date of the child and the remainder after the birth. Israelâ€™s social security system compensates the maternity leave if the employee is eligible which generally equals 15 weeks of fully paid leave and 11 weeks of unpaid leave.

Employees who have worked for the company for less than one year are entitled to only 15 weeks of maternity leave.

A team member may extend their maternity leave entitlement by three weeks in the case of multiple or complicated births. In the unfortunate circumstance that a mother loses her child after the birth, she may take unpaid maternity leave up to 60 days after the birth.

From the 7th week of leave, the mother can choose to return to work and transfer the remaining maternity leave period to her spouse.

### Paternity Leave

Following a partner going into labor and up to 24 hours following the birth, a team member is allowed to be absent from work for up to 5 days as paternity leave. The first three days of this leave will be paid from their accrued annual vacation and the remaining two days will be deducted from their accrued sick leave.

### Parental Leave

Fathers can take days off after the birth of a child, but these days will be subtracted from the maternity leave.

### Bereavement Leave

In Israel, in the event of a death of an immediate family member, team members are entitled to up to seven calendar days of paid leave to grieve for their loss.

### Service Duty Leave

In Israel, employees serving on reserve duty must still be paid by their employer. Military service is mandatory in Israel.
