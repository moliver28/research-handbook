#### Enrollment & Administration of the Pension Plan.

Shaldan is the operating agent who is responsible for ensuring funds are received by the pension accounts. 
 
When team members leave GitLab, they will need to connect with Shaldan to assist payroll in generating a form that will contain the amount of Severance payto fill out form 161.
