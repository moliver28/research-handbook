### Timekeeping

Officially mandatory as of 13 May 2019, every Spanish company has to keep track of when employees sign in and out of work, per Royal Decree 8/2019. All companies with a presence or operations in Spain must maintain records of the workday of each of their employees, and these time records must be kept for four years.

Trust-based working time generally refers to a GitLab's way of working, a flexible working time model in which team members can independently decide on the location and timing (i.e. beginning and end) of the contractually agreed working time. GitLab trusts that team members will fulfill their work obligations. A documentation of working hours does not stand in the way of such an agreement. This documentation does serve to protect the safety and health of employees and ensure rest is taken and overtime is paid.

#### Timekeeping Record

As of May 1, 2024 each GitLab Spain team member will be required to log their daily work time. We have provided a Google spreadsheet template, in English or Spanish. This record will be kept by Payroll and audited at any time.

#### Daily Work Time

In principle, employees have their eight-hour day for a standard working week of 40 hours, typically spread over five days. The maximum normal working hours per day is 9 hours (including one hour of rest/lunch).

#### Break Policy

At or before 6 hours of consecutive work, a break must be taken of at least 15 minutes.

#### Rest Policy

Between work days, team members are entitled to an uninterrupted rest period of 12 hours. Additionally team members are entitled to a weekly rest period of 1.5 uninterrupted days (usually taken on weekends).

#### Overtime

When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, team members may be scheduled to work overtime. Paid time off such as sick pay, holiday pay, vacation pay and jury duty pay (where applicable) will not count toward hours worked for the purpose of determining overtime pay.

Any hours worked beyond 40 hours per week qualifies as overtime. Employees cannot work more than 80 hours of overtime per year.  

**All overtime hours must be authorized in advance by the team member’s manager.** To request overtime, team members will submit an email to their manager with the following information, prior to working the overtime:

- Date of overtime requested
- Estimated number of hours
- Explanation why the work cannot be completed during regular working hours

**Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action.**

If as a team member, your workload is not able to be accomplished in the regular 40 hours per week, please discuss with your manager immediately.

#### Overtime Calculation

The overtime pay rate generally varies and is laid out in the employment contract; often, it depends on the collective bargaining agreement. The standard overtime pay rate in Spain is +75% of the regular hourly pay.

### Spain-Specific Team Member Benefits

[placeholder text]

Medical Plan via AXA -- 100% cover for the employee premium and 50% cover for dependent premium. The team member's portion of dependent cover will be deducted  from their monthly payroll. -- Plan premiums over 500 Euros per individual are considered a benefit in kind, and team members will be taxed on this amount.

Life Insurance plan: Team members will have a life and disability insurance policy. These premiums are also considered a benefit in kind and team members will be taxed on these amounts.

Temporary Medical Allowance: To make up for the transition period and pivot in our proposal, the TR team will be offering a monthly allowance of 140 Euros until December 31, 2024. After this period the allowance will cease. This will apply to any team member that started on the entity prior to July 1, 2023.

[FROM OLD REMOTE PAGE]

All of the benefits listed below are administered and managed by [Remote](https://remote.com/). Queries can be directed to help@remote.com.

### Healthcare

- Remote must offer [Allianz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMw61FsriqRPfcFRQ-mzQsu6HF03IUFB/view) premium plan to all employees (this covers team members only and does not include dependants).
- Team members have the option to waive this plan and instead can be paid a taxable bonus of up to $300/€252.35 each month, to be used to cover their own medical insurance and include dependants. This will be marked as 'bonus' on the payslip.
- Proof of coverage must be shared with Total Rewards. To do this, the team member may redact any personal information, upload to their Workday profile, and email to total-rewards@domain to confirm the same.
- Total Rewards will inform Payroll via the Payroll changes sheet
- Accruals for 13th and 14th month salaries
- General risks and unemployment insurance
- Salary guarantee fund (FOGASA)
- Work accident insurance

GitLab currently has no plans to offer Life Insurance, Private Medical cover, or a private pension due to the government cover in Spain. The [GitLab Life Insurance plan]({{< ref "general-and-entity-benefits#life-insurance" >}}) still applies.

### Statutory Leave Policies

Below is the information related to Spain's statutory leave policies.  Please note that team members hired in Spain are hired via Remote (PEO) and you should always check with Remote first for the most up to date information.

#### Holiday Leave

All full-time workers are legally entitled to 22 days paid holiday leave a year. In addition, full-time workers have 14 paid public holidays a year.

#### Paid Maternity leave

Employees in Spain are eligible for up to 16 weeks of Maternity leave. This rises to 18 weeks for twins and 20 weeks in the case of triplets. For children with disabilities there is an additional two weeks.

Four out of the 16 weeks may be taken prior to the birth of the child.  At least six uninterrupted weeks must be taken immediately following the birth. Also, if you have to take time off whilst pregnant for medical reasons, you are still entitled to the 16 weeks maternity leave after your child is born.

It is also possible to use the 16 weeks in combination with a part-time working timetable or even add holiday time that you are due in order to extend your leave.

For mothers of premature babies or where a baby has to remain in hospital for more than seven days following the birth, standard maternity leave can be extended for up to 13 weeks.

During the maternity period, team members are not paid a salary, but instead a maternity benefit. This contribution is paid directly from the [Social Security Administration](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Conocenos/QuienesSomos/29413?changeLanguage=es) to the employee.

Same-sex couples: both parents are entitled to paid leave. One will have to apply for paternity benefits, and the other for maternity benefits. However, in order to qualify for paid paternity (or maternity) benefits, it is essential that each parent has a legal link with the child. This means that paid leave will only be granted either:

 - If you are a biological parent; or
 - If you have legally adopted the child.
    - Being married to the biological or adoptive parent of a child does not qualify you for paid leave.

#### Applying for Maternity Leave

In order to be eligible for paid maternity leave, you must make sure to meet the following requirements:

- You must be working for a company, or as a self-employed worker.
- If you are below 21 years old, you won’t be required to have made contributions to social security before.
- If you are 21 to 26 years old, then you must be making contributions to social security for at least 90 days during the past 7 years, or 180 days during your entire working life.
- If you are over 26 years old, 180 days during the past 7 years or at least 360 days during your working life.

If you don’t meet this requirement, you can still get your maternity leave and get paid during those 16 weeks. Under certain conditions, you will get a non-contributory pension, which pays approximately 530€ per month. Team Members will need to request your [work-life certificate](https://balcellsgroup.com/employment-history-report/) at the “Tesorería de la Seguridad Social”, which can be requested online.

To help plan your leave click: [How Much Exactly Will You Get Paid On Leave](https://balcellsgroup.com/maternity-leave-spain/#How_much_exactly_will_you_get_paid_during_maternity_leave).

Please enter the dates of your leave in Time Off by Deel by selecting the `Parental leave` option.  The Absence Management team will contact you with more information.

#### Unpaid Maternity Leave

Excedencia sin sueldo offers the right to take extended leave from work for up to a maximum of three years in total for a mother to care for her children and still return to the same employer. You can request that your exact post be held for a maximum of one year, after which you may be offered a similar post for up to 2 years.

During this absence you will still be recognized as contributing to the social security system. You do not need to agree the time period with your employer beforehand and legally you are required to give two weeks notice before returning to your post.

#### Paternity Leave

Team Members in Spain are eligible for 16 weeks of Paternity leave.  The first six weeks must be taken immediately and consecutively after the child’s birth, whereas the other 10 weeks can be taken non-consecutively during the first 12 months of the baby’s life, which can be extended by one week per child in the case of a multiple birth. An extra week’s leave can also be applied for if the baby is born with a disability or health problems. If the baby is premature or has to be hospitalized for longer than seven days, leave can be extended for up to an additional 13 weeks.

This leave must be taken in batches of one week as a minimum, but the weeks can be split over time if desired. The father is also entitled to take unpaid childcare leave until the child is three years old.

Please enter the dates of your leave in Time Off by Deel by selecting the `Parental Leave` option.  The Absence Management team will contact you with more information.

#### Paternity Leave Payments

As long as the father has correctly paid his social security contributions—for a minimum of 180 working days within the past seven years or 360 total days in his entire professional life — 100% of his salary will be covered (as long as payment does not exceed 4070.10 EUR).

This money comes from the Spanish government, not his employer, though employers are liable for certain taxes that pertain to the salary, such as withholding.

#### Applying for Parental Leave in Spain

To initiate your parental leave, submit your time off by selecting the `Parental Leave` category in Time Off by Deel at least 30 days before your leave starts. Please familiarize yourself with [GitLab's Parental Leave policy]({{< ref "general-and-entity-benefits#parental-leave" >}}).

#### Breastfeeding leave

Parents can take an additional breastfeeding leave after parental leave. This breastfeeding leave can be enjoyed in two ways:

- take one hour off during the day, until the child is nine months old (it can either be one hour, or half an hour at the beginning and at the end of the working day)
- take 15 consecutive days after the parental leave

The breastfeeding leave is considered as working time, meaning that the employee doesn't receive anything from Social Security and is paid by the company at 100%.

### Other leave policies

- **Adoption leave:** upon adoption of a child or have taken in a foster child, employees are entitled to the same entitles apply as for maternity and paternity rights. Applies to both parents.  When adopting or fostering a child, each parent is eligible for the same 16 weeks as is the biological parent if the child is under six years old. If the child is older, both adoptive parents are eligible for the remaining optional 10 weeks that a biological parent would have after the first obligatory six weeks after birth.
- **Emergency and short absense leave:** intended for unforeseen personal circumstances for which an employee has to take time off immediately. Examples include making arrangements for the care of a sick family member or in the event of a death in the family. Up to two calendar days or four if travel is required.
- **Long-term care leave:** when a child, partner or parent of the employee is seriously (i.e. life threateningly) ill and requires care, the employee can request long-term care leave.
- **Unpaid leave:** the employee may take unpaid leave in consultation with the employer on a full-time or part-time basis. Granted at the discretion of the employer, but must always be set in an individual or collective agreement. Unpaid leave periods are not regulated by law.

### Spain-Specific Expenses

Team members will receive the monthly remote working allowance established under the CBA, which will be paid monthly, processed by payroll and will be listed on your payslip as 'PLUS TELETRABAJO'.

Any additional expenses will be reimbursed under the [GitLab Global Travel and Expense Policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/), up to any limits set by GitLab.
