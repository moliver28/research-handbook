### Timekeeping

Officially mandatory as of 13 May 2019, every Spanish company has to keep track of when employees sign in and out of work, per Royal Decree 8/2019. All companies with a presence or operations in Spain must maintain records of the workday of each of their employees, and these time records must be kept for four years.

Trust-based working time generally refers to a GitLab's way of working, a flexible working time model in which team members can independently decide on the location and timing (i.e. beginning and end) of the contractually agreed working time. GitLab trusts that team members will fulfill their work obligations. A documentation of working hours does not stand in the way of such an agreement. This documentation does serve to protect the safety and health of employees and ensure rest is taken and overtime is paid.

#### Timekeeping Record

As of May 1, 2024 each GitLab Spain team member will be required to log their daily work time. We have provided a Google spreadsheet template, in English or Spanish. This record will be kept by Payroll and audited at any time.

#### Daily Work Time

In principle, employees have their eight-hour day for a standard working week of 40 hours, typically spread over five days. The maximum normal working hours per day is 9 hours (including one hour of rest/lunch). 

#### Break Policy

At or before 6 hours of consecutive work, a break must be taken of at least 15 minutes.

#### Rest Policy

Between work days, team members are entitled to an uninterrupted rest period of 12 hours. Additionally team members are entitled to a 
weekly rest period of 1.5 uninterrupted days (usually taken on weekends).

#### Overtime

When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, team members may be scheduled to work overtime. Paid time off such as sick pay, holiday pay, vacation pay and jury duty pay (where applicable) will not count toward hours worked for the purpose of determining overtime pay.

Any hours worked beyond 40 hours per week qualifies as overtime. Employees cannot work more than 80 hours of overtime per year.  

**All overtime hours must be authorized in advance by the team member’s manager.** To request overtime, team members will submit an email to their manager with the following information, prior to working the overtime:

- Date of overtime requested
- Estimated number of hours
- Explanation why the work cannot be completed during regular working hours

**Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action.**

If as a team member, your workload is not able to be accomplished in the regular 40 hours per week, please discuss with your manager immediately.

#### Overtime Calculation

The overtime pay rate generally varies and is laid out in the employment contract; often, it depends on the collective bargaining agreement. The standard overtime pay rate in Spain is +75% of the regular hourly pay.

### Spain-Specific Team Member Benefits

[placeholder text]

Medical Plan via AXA -- 100% cover for the employee premium and 50% cover for dependent premium. The team member's portion of dependent cover will be deducted  from their monthly payroll. -- Plan premiums over 500 Euros per individual are considered a benefit in kind, and team members will be taxed on this amount.

Life Insurance plan: Team members will have a life and disability insurance policy. These premiums are also considered a benefit in kind and team members will be taxed on these amounts.

Temporary Medical Allowance: To make up for the transition period and pivot in our proposal, the TR team will be offering a monthly allowance of 140 Euros until December 31, 2024. After this period the allowance will cease. This will apply to any team member that started on the entity prior to July 1, 2024.

### Spain-Specific Expenses

Team members will receive the monthly remote working allowance established under the CBA, which will be paid monthly, processed by payroll and will be listed on your payslip as 'PLUS TELETRABAJO'.

Any additional expenses will be reimbursed under the [GitLab Global Travel and Expense Policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/), up to any limits set by GitLab.
