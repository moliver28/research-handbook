## Employee Surveys
Here at GitLab we use [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/?_gl=1*1gyk1qk*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAiA1-6sBhAoEiwArqlGPjLjIVfOHjS43kmsU2lBnEd0ad2e5nbZ44fmHE7qVcySj2xWbEyFghoCZ-gQAvD_BwE) to conduct our employee sentiment surveys. The People Technology team manages administative access to the tool and information about getting access can be found [here](/handbook/people-group/#using-culture-amp). If you are in need of support for a survey than this page will cover the best way to work with the People Analytics team for survey design, creation in Culture Amp, and review of results.
