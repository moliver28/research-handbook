## People Group Dashboard Inventory

Several dashboards have been published to the People project in the Tableau environment. Below is a brief overview of some of the dashboards created and where you can find them:

### General project

These dashboards are safe for general use by the Tableau User population here at GitLab.

- [Attrition Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2024177?:origin=card_share_link) - This dashboard gives turnover metrics for the organization. Rates can be filtered by `Rolling 12 Months`, `Fiscal Year to Date`,`Month to Date`, or `Quarter to Date` and different time periods can be selected. Dimensional breakouts of the data that result in small counts are hidden to protect Team Member identity.
- [Headcount Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/1864887?:origin=card_share_link) - This dashboard is used to get headcount metrics by different categories in the company. The user can filter to specific dates and time periods to evaluate changes in headcount.
- [Span of Control Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/1964349?:origin=card_share_link) - This dashboard allows for users to identify the current (and past) span of control by different departments, divisions, etc.

### People Restricted project

This project contains sensitive dashboards that only a small subset of users can view.

- [Attrition Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2018838?:origin=card_share_link) - Same uses as the one in General without hiding results and includes additional filters.
- [Span of Control](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/1871908?:origin=card_share_link) - Same uses as the one in General but with a detail tab showing a list of leaders and their direct span of control.
- [DIB Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/1953472?:origin=card_share_link) - This dashboard gives views and metrics of starts, turnover, and representation by different DIB categories.
- [People Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/1887121?:origin=card_share_link) - Intended for our [People Business Partners](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division), this dashboard is meant to be a way for PBPs to drill into the People Data for their stakeholders and identify various trends around group proportion sizes, URG representation, and metrics like turnover in one place.
- [Talent Flow Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/1907866?:origin=card_share_link) - This is a tableau version of the [People Weekly Overview Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8Hl301wDqJlGg8JyxHdpa4DZdttuaX23-BRyWruMA4/edit#gid=221950393) shared with leaders. This version has sensitive data and is only available in the Restricted folder for now.
