# Promotion Document Style Guide

Assembling a case for promotion can be a time-consuming process. The tips and style principles in this guide will help you prepare a document that presents the evidence clearly, requiring fewer review cycles.

The emphasis on quantification over editorialization has a number of benefits for both the reader and the author:

- It's easier to gradually assemble the document over time, and to understand the level of completion at any point.
- The document reads more confidently and, crucially, more objectively.
- Cases for promotion to the same role are more readily comparable to each other and the job family criteria, with consistent tone.
- The presentation is maximally inclusive, requiring less context on the part of the reader.

## Tips

1. Minimize the use of adjectives and adverbs
   - **Don't**:
     - _"significantly improved the performance of the most important Plan endpoints"_
   - **Do**:
     - _"reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB) by an average of 180ms for the 5 most visited Plan endpoints"_
   - **Why**: Adjectives and adverbs are imprecise and make it difficult for the reader to understand the true impact and the person's exact contribution to it.
1. Ensure quantification is appropriate and meaningful
   - **Don't**:
     - _"increased page views by 10 million over a 3 month period"_
   - **Do**:
     - _"increased monthly page views by 25% over a 3 month period, from 8 million to 10 million."_
   - **Why**:
     - Ensures that statements pass the “so what” test, requiring no further investigation on the part of the reader.
1. Only use numbered links to list examples, not to describe how the person did something. Instead describe the contribution and link parts of the text
   - **Don't**
     - _"Bob brought a critical user feature from the architectural stage right through to General Availability (GA) [1,2,3,4,5]"_
   - **Do**
     - _"Bob created an architecture blueprint, with a proof of concept implementation to validate the proposed solution and aid estimation. As a result, the project was delivered on time in 3 MRs [1,2,3]."_
   - **Why**: Avoids the need for the reader to investigate each link individually and figure out for themselves what the person's contribution actually was, often from a large issue or discussion.
1. Expand acronyms first time they appear
   - **Don't**:
     - _"Jane worked with the PM for the stage to establish the Customer Engagement WG."_
   - **Do**:
     - _"Jane worked with the Product Manager (PM) to establish the Customer Engagement Working Group (WG)."_
   - **Why**: Peer reviewers in your field of expertise may be familiar with the acronyms but most readers will not. Many acronyms are unclear and there are collisions between disciplines (e.g. Total Addressable Market and Technical Account Manager).
1. Focus on ability at the next level
   - **Don't**:
   - **Do**:
   - **Why**: Space is limited and detailing contributions at the current level does not materially contribute to the case for promotion.
1. Business Justification should describe how the person's role will change if promoted
   - **Don't**:
   - **Do**:
   - **Why**:

## Additional Tips

- Avoid unnecessary filler words or phrases:
  - Arguably
  - In order to
  - It should be noted that
  - Due to the fact that
- Double-check that links point to the right resource and that it is available to your expected readership.

- Avoid sentences over 30 words
- Stick to the template. If it asks for two examples, give the two best examples.
