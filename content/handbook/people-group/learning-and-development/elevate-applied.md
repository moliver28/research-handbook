## Elevate Applied

**Apply what you learned in Elevate to build your high performing team.**

Leaders at GitLab should feel supported with excellent resources to enable their practice, application, and integration of concepts taught in [Elevate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/elevate/) to their day to day work at GitLab.

To provide this support, the Talent Development team is launching `Elevate Applied`.

If you've had thoughts or questions like:

1. `I could really use time to connect with other managers at GitLab and learn from their experience.`
1. `The GROW model sounds great - but I can't find opportunities to actually apply it.`
1. `I know how to give feedback to my team, but I'm not sure how or when to start.`
1. `How can I build stronger performance on my team?`

... then `Elevate Applied` is for you.

`Elevate Applied` is an ongoing resource for Managers and Senior Managers at GitLab meant to strengthen leadership competencies, enable leaders to take action, and build connections between managers. **It's a combined community and toolkit to help you build high performing teams.**

Beginning in January 2024, the Talent Development team will pilot this program with the ~130 managers who earned their Elevate certification in 2023. We'll use data and feedback from the pilot to inform and shape the future of manager training at GitLab.


## Overview

All managers who earned their Elevate certification in 2023 will be invited to participate. The pilot will run for 4 months, starting in January and ending in April. Participation is optional.

Each month, managers can expect to be served new resources and learning opportunities that are relevant to what is currently happening in the business. Some examples include:

1. Group coaching sessions
1. Self-paced Level Up courses
1. Templates and tools to assess and implement Elevate concepts and strategies
1. Organized calls to meet and discuss common challenges with other managers
1. Speaker sessions with internal and external experts
