# Elevate Applied

Leaders should feel supported and be given excellent resources to enable their practice, application, and integration of concepts taught in [Elevate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/elevate/) to their day to day work at GitLab.

For this reason, we're launching `Elevate Applied`.

`Elevate Applied` is a continuous learning journey for Managers and Senior Managers at GitLab meant to strengthen leadership competencies and build connections between managers to build high performing teams.

Beginning in January 2024, the Talent Development team will pilot this program with the ~130 managers who earned their Elevate certification in 2023. We'll use data and feedback from their experience to inform and shape the future of managers training at GitLab. 


## Overview

All managers who earned their Elevate certification in 2023 will be invited to participate. The pilot will run for 4 months, starting in January and ending in April. 

Each month, managers can expect to be served a new resource or learning opportunity. Some examples include:

1. Group coaching sessions
1. Self-paced Level Up courses
1. Templates and tools to assess and implement Elevate concepts and strategies
1. Organized calls to meet and discuss common challenges with other managers


All work is optional.

## Benefits

By the end of this 4-month pilot, managers can expect to:

1. Understand and use resources that help them apply concepts taught in Elevate, including:
     - Access to ongoing 1:1 coaching to support their growth in FY25
     - Coaching techniques to build a high performing team
     - Conversation strategies for giving and recieving feedback
     - Frameworks and templates for efficient career growth conversations
1. Expand their network and build upon existing relationships with other managers across the organization


## Measuring Success

The Talent Development team will focus on the following metrics to measure success of this pilot:

1. NPS score on self-paced coursework
1. Direct manager feedback
1. Aggregate and anonymous feedback from coaching partners
