`Team Workshops` are customized, group learning opportunities for teams at GitLab. Workshops are interactive, collaborative, and led by expert facilitators. They are designed to address specific skill gaps, create space and time for building connection and trust, and developing shared best practices.

The program is available to all teams at GitLab, including teams of individual contributors and people leaders. Workshop duration is varied.

Currently offered workshops cover the following skills:

1. Having Difficult Conversations
1. Executive Presence and Influence
1. Storytelling
1. Building Trust and Resiliency
1. Leading through Change
1. Inclusive Leadership
1. Open and Effective Communication
1. Decision Making and Managing Ambiguity
1. Unconscious Bias

_These skills were selected and prioritized based on themes derived from the [talent development listening tour](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/listening-tour/), feedback from People Business Partners, and Elevate Programs._
