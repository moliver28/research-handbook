## Vision

The People Business Partners are trusted and strategic advisors, coaches, and change agents to senior leadership, providing data driven insights and expertise on people-related matters, to inform and support a tightly aligned business and talent strategy.

## Our Team

Each People Business Partner (PBP) at GitLab is aligned to one or more specific departments or divisions and partner with the leaders of those teams to provide consultation on a range of talent matters. PBPs provide leadership coaching, talent program execution, and drive relevant people-focused initiatives that foster a high performance culture within our teams.

## How we work

PBPs become embedded within their client group in order to ensure a deep understanding of their teams’ business goals and priorities, how they work, and how best to align the People Group goals with the business goals to ensure we are driving a high performance culture in each division. PBPs attend leadership staff meetings and offsites, get to know team members, and are the DRI for talent programs and initiatives within the team.

PBPs collaborate across the People Group to ensure people and business strategy are tightly aligned. PBPs are responsible for the execution of many people group driven programs within their aligned division including our talent management programs, total rewards programs, engagement survey action planning, and specific organizational health initiatives driven by the unique needs of each team. We do this by collaborating closely with the DRIs on these programs, as well as the leadership team of each division.

## How to partner with PBPs to foster high performance in your team:

### Team Structure and Organizational Health

People Business Partners partner with senior leadership to drive organizational design initiatives in each division that drive results and enable a culture of belonging and career growth. Please reach out to your PBP to discuss new organizational structures or re-alignment of team members.

Additionally, PBPs support team member engagement in each division using sentiment data from our engagement surveys and driving action planning in the divisions. You can also talk to your PBP about specific retention concerns or strategies as needed.

### Collaborating with the PBP team on projects

**If you would like People Business Partners' input, collaboration, or feedback on an issue or MR, please add the `pbp-attention` label, which will flag the issue for triaging on our People Business Partner issue board.** See the [People Business Partner Issue Board](#people-business-partner-issue-board) section below for more information on our triaging and lableing process.

### People Business Partner Issue Board

The People Business Partners (PBPs) have an [issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1898818?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened) to track collaboration on issues across GitLab.com to keep us efficient and collaborative with other teams.

We utilize labels for triaging amongst the PBPs, and to indicate to other teams the level of priority for the PBPs and the status (doing, done, etc.)

People Business Partners often collaborate with others in People Group or other teams on talent programs where the [DRI](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) sits outside the PBP team. PBP’s can provide business context, needs analysis, championship of new programs in our aligned client groups, and support change management related to new initiatives. To clarify the PBP’s role in a project, we have provided the following framework to help ensure the goals of the collaboration are met. The PBP team works together to assign the appropriate PBPs to cross-functional projects to ensure a diverse view of the business is included. PBPs play a key role in bringing talent programs to life in each division. A framework for how collaborate in project teams is below.

| PBP Role in a Project    | What to expect | Program examples |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Accountable  | PBP is not the enterprise program DRI, but is responsible for the execution in their client group. The program requires significant lift by team members/managers. In this type of project, a PBP is part of the core project team to bring business perspective to the build phase, helps develop a communication/change mgmt plan, and executes the program in their aligned client group, including any bespoke enablement needed. The PBP is often the face of this program for their client group, and recipient of team member feedback | Talent Assessment, Promotion, ACR    |
| Consulted | PBP provides input on how the program can be most effectively communicated or embedded in their division, but may not have a direct role in execution. Engaging the assigned PBP in reviewing comms or supporting change management can help drive adoption deeper in the organization |Elevate   |
| Informed    | PBPs should be made aware of the project as it will impact team members and questions may be directed toward the PBP team. If PBPs are given a preview of comms for final feedback and visibility before launch, they can help ensure the comms will meet the needs of their client group | Policy or benefit changes that impact team members    |

#### Triaging and Labeling Flow

1. `pbp-attention` label is added by team member/group seeking input, collaboration, or feedback on an issue or MR. This will flag the issue for triaging on our People Business Partner issue board. *Note: While MRs will not appear on our board, we ask that the `pbp-attention` label is added regardless for analytics purposes.*
1. The PBP team will triage the issue in accordance of PBP priority. Each scoped label will have one PBP DRI, *plus* the additional number of PBP reviewers indicated depending on the level of priority.
1. The PBP who is the DRI will indicate they are the DRI by tagging themselves in the issue.
    - `pbp::low` 1 PBP DRI with 1 additional reviewer
    - `pbp::medium` 1 PBP DRI with 2 additional PBP reviewers
    - `pbp::high` 1 PBP DRI with 3 additional PBP reviewers (at least one should be at the Director level)
1. If the issue is coming from another team seeking PBP collaboration, the PBP team will add the label of the other team for analytics purposes.
    - `pbp-DIB` (Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging)
    - `pbp-LD` (Learning & Development)
    - `pbp-TR` (Total Rewards)
    - `pbp-legal`
    - `pbp-peopleops`
    - `pbp-talent-acquisition`
    - `pbp-other`
1. The PBP team will add the `pbp-done` label when PBP action is complete.

You may reference the [GitLab.com labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&subscribed=&search=pbp) for an overview of all labels included in the PBP issue board triaging and labeling process.
