## What is a Quarterly Talent Review?

The Quarterly Talent Review (QTR) is a strategic mechanism designed to bring together People Business Partners (PBPs) and People Group Centers of Excellence (COEs) to meet with division leaders and review key organizational health metrics.

The QTR provides an opportunity for the People team to align on key priorities, discuss top-of-mind topics for each COE, and track action items, all while freeing up division leaders to focus on more strategic initiatives in partnership with the COEs. This approach ensures the People team shows up as one unified group and drives alignment across the organization and one team.

## Quarterly Talent Review Timeline

The QTR report will be delivered to PBPs on the 15th day at the start of each quarter (dates below). This report will serve as the foundation for the discussions with division leaders.
