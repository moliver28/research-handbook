## Organizational Health and Capability Reviews

To further our principles of responsible growth, we review organizational health metrics and capability on a regular cadence.

In addition to ongoing company level review and People Group KPIs, People Business Partners provide insights and recommendations to senior leaders based on organizational health metrics at a Division level.  A holistic review of organizational health metrics such as growth rate, turnover, promotion rate, engagement data, organizational shape, span of control, [Single Points of Failure](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent-and-single-points-of-failure-spof) and DIB metrics support leaders in making data-driven talent decisions, such as organizational design, budget planning, and headcount planning.

You can review more on our organizational structure on this [handbook page](/handbook/company/team/structure)

### Cadence of Division Level Organizational Health Reviews

Throughout the year, People Business Partners (PBPs) can access organizational health data at the Division level (and in some cases Department level) in Tableau through [People Dashboards](/handbook/people-group/people-ops-tech-analytics/people-analytics/people-tableau/) managed by the [People Analytics team](/handbook/people-group/people-ops-tech-analytics/people-analytics/).

In addition to the ongoing review of organizational health trends throughout the year, we have two formal touchpoints built in to ensure cross functional alignment to our organizational design strategy, and to inform budget planning.

At a Division level, we review organizational design capability on the following cadence:

#### Q1: Organizational Design Kickoff

**Purpose:** Provide cross-functional visibility to senior leadership on the organizational design outcomes following Annual Planning. Illuminate opportunities to drive efficiency or alignment across GitLab through our org design.

**Process:** PBP works with senior leader to compile an exec summary inclusive of: organizational design outcomes, critical hires/key talent for the upcoming year, and mitigation plans for identified single points of failure based on final funding decisions.

#### Q3: Organizational Design Planning

**Purpose:** Assess organizational capability and gaps leveraging a prepared summary of current organizational health metrics and trends in advance of Q4 Talent Assessment and [Annual Planning](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/#fy25-plan-milestones).
Identify single points of failure and proposed mitigation strategies, including budget required to mitigate.

**Process:** In collaboration with People Analytics, PBP reviews a prepared summary of current org health metrics and trends with e-group leaders/senior leadership to identify opportunities and prepare for Annual Planning. Organizational Health metrics include: growth, turnover rate, promotion rate, organizational shape (distribution by level), span of control, and representation metrics.

In collaboration with FP&A, PBP provides summary of how upcoming FY plan impacts org health.

### Benchmark Data

Wherever possible, we leverage external benchmark data to analyze organizational design and ensure that we are taking peer group and industry standards into account when measuring our own organizational shape and health. Some of the key benchmark data we review are:

- Span of Control (SPOC): number of team members directly reporting to a manager
- Organizational shape: the % distribution of team members by job level within an organization

We review data for a Peer Group and against the Industry. "Peer Group" is a group of similar companies, and "Industry" is the Software Products & Services industry.


## Organizational Design Planning Playbook

At GitLab, a high-performance culture underpins our strategy. Having the right team structure in place enables teams to act with urgency, collaborate effectively, and deliver results for our customers. At times, we need to reevaluate how a team is set up and make structural changes that unlock higher-quality results. Our organizational health and capability review process is a data point that can aid organizational design planning strategy. 

The purpose of this playbook is to enable leaders at GitLab to make thoughtful and strategic organizational design decisions. It’s intended to be used by people leaders in partnership with their aligned People Business Partner (PBP).

Generally, there are 5 phases when making an organizational change:

1. Planning and goal definition and alignment
2. Org design decisions
3. Communication of changes
4. Execution of changes
5. Measuring success

### Planning

When considering making organizational changes, consider how your new organizational design contributes to the overall company strategy, how it will accelerate or drive improved business results, and how it aligns with our values.

It is important to engage the aligned PBP early in the process to ensure the change is executed effectively and decisions are made in a fair and compliant manner. You should also identify a DRI who will be responsible for the execution of the change as part of the planning phase.

Some questions you can consider to aid in this planning process include:


| Question | Process |
| ------ | ------ |
|  What are your org design principles (i.e. what are you optimizing your team structure for)?      |   - Use a [SWOT analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ao9R0ILsBLVJDd7_smFOW5ClNR9McXo1JToeX-cC6Ec/edit#slide=id.g2aeb7e9339e_0_145) to  assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the current org structure which may highlight opportunity areas to address.<br> - Visualize the current and future org structure (for example in a Google Slide presentation or a Lucid chart). This will also be useful with stakeholders and may unlock items that need to be addressed in change management.<br> - Examples of org design principles: Faster collaboration by realigning teams that work together frequently or rely on each other to deliver results    |
|   What risks exist if you make a change to a new org design?     |   Consider these identified risks in the change management plan to proactively alleviate the impact. For example, if retention is a concern, consider targeted engagement strategies including 1:1s and engaging with the team member on a development plan.      |
| What risks exist if we do not make the recommended changes? | Change can be difficult to navigate, but sometimes, not iterating is detrimental. Weigh the pros and cons to make a thoughtful decision |
| What improvements do you expect? | Examples: Faster delivery of projects? Higher quality results due to better collaboration? Increased visibility to customer needs? These identified improvements will be helpful to articulate when communicating changes. These also will be important success criteria to measure after the implementation of the organizational change. |
| What needs to happen to achieve this org design? | Work with your People Business Partner to think about the change management process, tactical and strateigic steps required, and any other deliverables. This helps you narrow in on an appropriate time frame for execution.  |


##### Define Goals

Now that you have determined an organizational change is required and have a strategy in place, it’s helpful to ensure the goals of the organizational change are clear and aligned to our CREDIT values. Defining goals is critical to accomplish two core objectives:

**1. Supporting the change management process:** Consider that you will need to bring others along on this journey. Effective change management requires all those impacted to understand why the change was made, what the change entails, and why the change helps us build a foundation for high performance through an optimal team structure. Defining goals up front also enables us to measure success in the future.

**2. Objective decision making:** Ensuring you have a northstar or clearly defined goals in place help ensure fairness and consistency in decision making, enable a stronger communication plan, and help you measure the success of the org change following the event.

##### Define Success Criteria

To be able to effectively measure the success of an organizational change, the success criteria for the change *should be defined before the change goes into effect* and align with the goals for the change. This helps us reflect back on the impact of our decisions to ensure we are consistently learning from and iterating appropriately.

### Org Design Decisions

There are several key elements to consider when thinking through org design decisions and their impact in the near and long term. Key areas to think through include:

**Roles and responsibilities**

Once you have a clear vision of where you need to reprioritize resources to meet your business goals it’s time to consider who in the team is best equipped to deliver in these roles. PBPs can work closely with you to understand the business goals and roles and determine a fair and objective framework to make decisions about roles and responsibilities.

**Compliance**

It is imperative that we consider local requirements specific to each team member's location if job duties may be changing. PBPs collaborate with Team Member Relations and Legal to ensure that anytime a team member’s current role is impacted, we are doing so in compliance with local regulations. Gathering these requirements up front is critical.

**Scope and Job Levels**

When considering scope and associated job levels, the (GitLab Job Frameworks) [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FX4NBwF099uMBm7mGBtf1orIJZuHEjtiEa3jSbg9jJs/edit#gid=0] provide general guidelines to ensure the scope of a team member’s role is aligned to their contributions and impact

**Organizational Shape**

A diverse mix of roles at all levels and a healthy span of control for people managers are key to an efficient team structure. As needed, PBPs can work with Total Rewards to review annual benchmark data related to job level distribution and span of control at a division level to check if there are ways to consider optimizing the team structure.

**Stakeholders**

In partnership with your PBP, compile a list of stakeholders that need to be either consulted or informed about this change.

Team Members who need to be consulted should have input on the change at some point in the planning and decision-making phases, and Team Members who need to be informed should only be made aware of the change as part of the communication cascade following decision-making.  In the planning and decision-making phases, it may not be possible to be completely transparent depending on the nature of the project. Align with your PBP on who should be consulted, how, and when.

Once you have identified your stakeholders, you can put together a timeline that will include when and how they will be consulted or informed of the change. Utilize the section below phase 3 “Communication" as a resource for that part of the process.

**Timing of execution**

Depending on the scale of the realignment or reorganization that you are implementing, consider the tradeoffs between the disruption that occurs when making any changes to team members’ roles or focus areas and the benefit of reprioritizing a team member’s work. There are a few key elements to consider when thinking through timing and whether or not it makes sense to move forward with an organizational change.

- **Frequency**: Realignments and organization structural changes can be disruptive for team members and impact results in the short term as team members settle into new roles/teams, engage with new stable counterparts, managers, etc.  Frequent realignment may create more churn than benefit. When possible, taking a holistic review of the team and considering other upcoming changes that may be needed can help consolidate the amount of time needed to refocus the team.
- **Disruption To Deliverables**: It is important to consider the impact the change could have on our Customers, milestones, and our ability to achieve results. For example:
    - _In Sales_, if you are planning the change to happen towards the end of the quarter, will it take away from the Sales team’s ability to achieve or exceed their number, and potential impact to quota. If changes will impact anything related to commissions, they will need to go into effect on the 1st or 16th of the month.
    - _In R&D_, consideration should also be given to impacts on [product category maturity](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/) commitments for teams with team members that are moving to new groups. When possible, change should respect the [Product Development Timeline](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline) to allow impacted teams to complete existing work and ensure smooth and efficient transitions.
- **Talent Program Timeline**: During company-wide programs such as Talent Assessment and Annual Compensation Review, Workday is frozen for processing new changes. Be aware that processing manager changes during these programs may be delayed. Additionally, if someone is changing managers during a process where the manager’s insight into prior year performance is integral, it can create additional work as a new manager steps in mid-cycle.


### Communication

Enabling team members to refocus on their work quickly and effectively after an organizational change is supported by having a thorough and thoughtful communication plan. Resources to aid in communication that are available include: 

1. [Leading Through Change: Guidance For Managers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1maWy0CEu7-PqGtxPnppMBl8NyE1cmktNmN7HuQtSibw/edit#slide=id.g123a13deda8_0_405): A refresh for managers on how to support team members through change
2. [Realignment Communication Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Q6BIniQK8lGUvkpBKuGFxv9WtyBEKGwUMs1LUTd0es/edit#heading=h.dzhtklppkb8): A communication plan template to help structure comms cascades for realignments

The following principles aligned to our CREDIT values aid in a smooth and successful announcement of an organizational change.

##### Collaboration

It is important to consider a full list of team members who may need to be consulted or informed. A strong communication plan helps team members know how to collaborate in the new team structure and minimize delays in productivity. Effectively cascading the message is a critical part of communication and ensuring ongoing effective collaboration. Key touchpoints for effective message cascading to include in [communication plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Q6BIniQK8lGUvkpBKuGFxv9WtyBEKGwUMs1LUTd0es/edit#heading=h.dzhtklppkb8) are:

- Directly impacted team members should be informed before peers learn of the change
- Executive or senior leadership team as appropriate
- Direct or indirect stakeholders or collaborators including FP&A if appropriate
- People managers who may receive questions should understand what is happening, why, and how it affects their team. This group may be informed in advance of a broader message to ensure they’re prepared to support their teams. For larger changes, the PBP may recommend a manager information guide (aka FAQ) is prepared and shared with the appropriate audience
- The changes may be relevant to or impact other Divisions. Communicate the vision, timeline, and actions related to the change to cross-functional teams (I.E. Product and Engineering alignment).

##### Results

It is key to communicate the goals of the change and what success looks like. This should be tied back to the defined goals, objectives, and measurements of success from the planning and decision phases of the process.

##### Efficiency

Choosing the right type of communication vehicle is important to consider is driving the right outcome. Options to consider include:

- 1:1 sync calls: Directly impacted team members and stakeholders who may have complex questions
- Team calls: Sharing the change with a broader audience who may be affected by the change but aren’t directly moving to a new team or manager
- Slack: Broader updates for transparency and awareness


##### Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging

A key part of communication and change management is providing diverse opportunities for team members to ask questions in a setting that is comfortable for them. Options to consider include:

- AMAs: useful for generally applicable questions for a larger-scale change
- 1:1s/Coffee Chats: leaders may decide to do coffee chats or 1:1s to check in on team members following a change. For some, this is a more accessible place to ask questions.
- PBP Presence: It’s helpful to include PBPs in announcements so team members who feel more comfortable going to a PBP know who the appropriate person is


##### Iteration

Remember to remain open to feedback on the proposed change. It is important to remain iterative based on new information presented through feedback or retrospectives and as business opjectives shift and priorities change. 

##### Transparency

A key piece of transparency is ensuring the “why” is clear. A thoughtful planning and decision-making process should result in identifying themes that are useful to share to help team members understand the change. Work with your PBP to ensure you remain compliant when communicating any changes that impact team members. 

### Execution

### Measuring Success


## Single Points of Failure (SPOF)

Single Points of Failure (SPOF) refers to a single person whose absence would significantly impact the ability of an area of the company to function. The purposee of identifying Single Points of Failure within the organization is to ensure that risk is mitigated and to highlight and inform potential gaps in the context of current hiring and headcount planning for the next fiscal year.

Team members that are identified as Key Talent can also be SPOF, as the definition of SPOF overlaps with a few of the [Key Talent Criteria outlined](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent-criteria), however, a **team member who is identified as SPOF is not also Key Talent by default.**

A few key differences between Key Talent and SPOF include: team member’s performance and growth potential, risk mitigation plans, and support/development strategies. While the [impact of being identified as Key Talent](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#impact-of-being-identified-as-key-talent) is focused primarily on growth opportunities, compensation, and influencing succession planning, the impact of being identified as SPOF is primarily focused on risk mitigation.

Note that all team members should be having regular [career conversations](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#having-career-conversations) with their managers regardless of whether they are identified as SPOF, Key Talent, or neither one. The risk mitigation focus for SPOF does not imply growth is not important for these individuals, but rather that leaders have an additional responsibility to be mindful of business continuity and mitigate risk to ensure organizational health remains strong.

A key aspect of identifying Single Points of Failure (SPOF) within the organization, is creating mitigation plans to minimize and eventually eliminate risk for the business. [This template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBqr7Tj9gnRmkUHGG53ezDlPpu_rCvkveGiOvYLGJp8/edit) is available for leadership and managers to partner to think through and document risk mitigation strategies and timeline for team members identified as SPOF. While not required, documentation of mitigation plans is highly encouraged.

SPOF identification is typically at the Functional Leaders level, or sometimes one level down due to organization size, but the SPOF identification should always be shared back to the direct manager to ensure awareness and close collaboration on the mitigation plan and execution. In larger organizations, it is beneficial to review and discuss team members identified as SPORs with the broader management chain for feedback and alignment.

### SPOF Examples

Examples of Single Points of Failure and potential risk mitigation strategies include:

1. Critical skillset

- Scenario: We have recently prioritzed a new initiative within the business. We only have a couple of team members in the organization with the skillset to work on this critical work. The consequence of one or both of these team members leaving GitLab is extremely significant and impactful to our near term ability to achieve our goals.

- Potential Mitigation Stategies: Headcount - Prioritize near term headcount to ensure we are bringing in more team members with this skillset to support the initiative and who have this skillset. Knowledge sharing - Create opportunities for other team members interested in learning more to learn from these individuals more immediately through "Office Hours", an internal internship, etc.

1. Historical knowledge

- Scenario: We have a long tenured senior team member who has been with GitLab for several years. This individual has critical historical knowledge of our code base and frequently helps when dealing with high pressure high stakes technical situations to accelerate understanding and uncover "whys" connected to historical context to drive us forward. On multiple occasions when S1 incidents have arisen, this individual has been one of the only people able to get us to quick resolution due to the historical knowledge they have.

- Potential Mitigation Stategies: Work distribution - Review whether other senior ICs on the team can partner with this individual to take on/support some of their scope so moving forward knowledge is less concentrated. Knowledge sharing - when this individual is called in to support incidents, ask that another team member "shadows" the process and resolution for real time learning.

1. Key leader

- Scenario: We have a critical leader on the team who has a significant portion of the company in their organization, a high span of control (SPOC), and who has become critical for the efficiency of cross-functional initiatives with company-wide impact. A significant part of our ARR is directly influenced by this individual, and the majority of the managers under them are new to management and leadership. If this individual were to depart GitLab, there would be no one who could step in even temporarily to pick up the work without significant impact to business continuity.

- Potential Mitigation Stategy: Organizational structure - Review organizational structure to explore options to get span of control (SPOC) is a more manageable place, and potentially split the group under this leader across 2-3 leaders so criticality becomes distributed. Facilitate a mentor/mentee relationship between the current leader and leaders who step in to support to ensure context is passed on and knowledge is shared. Headcount - Identify a successor for this leader by urgently reprioritizing to allocate headcount to hire someone in.

**Please note that situations and mitigation strategies can and will look different across the business. The examples above are meant to provide additional color in terms of what we mean by "SPOF", but it certainly not an exhaustive list of examples of these situations or of options to mitigate risk for the business.**

1. Single Owner of a Program and/or Process

- Scenario: We have a team member that is the single owner of a program and/or process that impacts a critical area of the business. If they were to leave, intellectual property about the program and/or process would be gone impacting our ability to achieve results.

- Potential Mitigation strategies: Ensure proper documentation exists for the program and/or process. Cross-train another team member on the program and/or process so there is knowledge shared on the particular program and/or process. Consider prioritizing additional headcount to ensure we have proper coverage.
