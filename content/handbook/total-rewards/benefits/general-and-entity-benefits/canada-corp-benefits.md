Per the statutory requirements in Canada, a team member is ineligible to receive any Employment Insurance payments if they are receiving full parental leave pay from GitLab.

You can visit [My Service Canada Account (MSCA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html) to view ROEs issued for you by past and recent employers, but if it's not there you can email or ping the Non-US payroll team and they will ask the payroll provider to provide one.

## Other Leave Types

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Ontario</summary>

The following statutory leave types run concurrently with GitLab PTO. Each leave is separate, and the right to each leave is independent of any right a team member may have to other leave(s). A team member may be entitled to more than one leave for the same event. A team member's entitlement to any statutory leaves of absence is governed by the legislation applicable in the province in which the employee works for the Company. Statutory leaves of absence will be tracked separately. Any additional paid or unpaid leaves provided by GitLab, are inclusive of, and not in addition to, any concurrent paid or unpaid leaves provided by the applicable employment standards legislation. Additional information can be found on the [Government of Ontario website](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0). Statutory leave for which team members are not entitled to pay will be paid at 100% of the team member's salary for the first 25 days. If the team member is eligible for a government benefit, GitLab will supplement the payment so that the team member receives 100% of their salary for the first 25 days.

To initiate leave, and ensure that statutory entitlements are properly tracked, team members should contact `leaves@domain.com` and then submit the time off request by selecting the appropriate option in Workday.
