Using GitLab's Growth and Development Fund is a great way for team members to help drive their own career development. GitLab team-members are eligible for a reimbursement of up to $10,000 USD per calendar year (January 1st - December 31st) depending on tenure, performance, company need for the learned skill, and available budget. 

This handbook page provides a curated list of recommended Growth and Development opportunities.

Before filling out any Growth and Development Application, remember the process should always start with a career development conversation with your manager to discuss the learning opportunity. Itâ€™s important to discuss timing, capacity, and application timeline for both the program and fund processing. This conversation should allow time for you to apply for the program and your manager to ensure team capacity.
