title: Growth and Development Select
description: A list of recommended Growth and Development Opportunities
---

Using GitLab's Growth and Development (G&D) Fund is a great way for team members to help drive their own career development. GitLab team-members are eligible for a reimbursement of up to $10,000 USD per calendar year (January 1st - December 31st) depending on tenure, performance, company need for the learned skill, and available budget.

This handbook page provides a curated list of recommended Growth and Development opportunities. We've put it together to act as a guide or as inspiration for team members who want to use the G&D fund, but aren't sure of where to begin. The list is largely made up of courses or conferences that have previously been completed or attended by GitLab team members. If you would like to get in touch with a team member who has previously taken part in an opportunity you're considering, try searching the name of the opportunity in the `GitLab.com` project, using the `GrowthDevelopment` label, or reach out in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.

The intention is for this page to act as a guide - even if you're in the department / division that aligns with the conference or course, it may not be right for you. Remember, before filling out any Growth and Development Application, the process should always start with a career development conversation with your manager to discuss the learning opportunity. Itâ€™s important to discuss timing, capacity, and application timeline for both the program and fund processing. This conversation should allow time for you to apply for the program and your manager to ensure team capacity.

### Adding to the list

We're always keen to hear about team members' experiences using the Growth and Development Fund, especially if you feel that your opportunity could be worth adding to the G&D Select list. Please post in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel to tell us more about your experience, or tag `@jallen16` in your G&D request issue.
