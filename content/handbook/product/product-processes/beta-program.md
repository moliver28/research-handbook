description: "Alignment & vision of the GitLab Beta Program"

# Purpose

The GitLab Beta Program aims to increase engagement with early adopters, create brand ambassadors while also increasing the level of feedback received on non-GA high-priority features.

## Key group that formed alignment on product direction

* Emilio Salvador
* Justin Farris
* Nick Veenhof
* Steve Evangelista
* Valerie Karnes

## Alignments

1. Naming is hard. We're flexible and this is up for change
2. We will not gate features from users.
3. There has to be an required & explicit acceptance to the terms & conditions of our testing agreement before Beta or Experimental features can be used.
4. There is an optional opt-in to receive marketing communications regarding beta or experimental features. 
5. Guidance from UX & Product should be followed how this gets implemented for a consistent user experience.
