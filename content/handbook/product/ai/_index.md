This page serves as a resource for team members looking for information about working on AI features at GitLab. The first iteration of this page is a list of links, loosely organized. This will improve as we build up our best practices and consolidate/improve our documentation.

## Getting started on an AI feature
* [Suggest an AI feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=AI%20Project%20Proposal&issue%5Btitle%5D=AI+Feature+Proposal:+): Issue template for suggesting or requesting an AI feature

## Design and UX research for AI features
* [Pajamas AI guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/ai-human-interaction): How to design the user experience for AI features. Includes design patterns and guidelines.
* [UX Research in AI space](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/research-in-the-ai-space/): Helps team members evaluate the usefullness and usability of AI features.

## Special considerations for AI features
* [AI ethics principles](/handbook/legal/ethics-compliance-program/ai-ethics-principles/#1-avoid-unfair-bias): Principles to guide our decision making as we continue to build AI features into GitLab and to ensure that these features properly embody our values.
* [AI data usage and privacy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ai_features.html#data-usage): Public facing docs about how we use and protect data.
* (Coming soon) Measuring AI accuracy
