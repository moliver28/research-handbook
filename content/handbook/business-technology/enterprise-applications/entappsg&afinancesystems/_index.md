### System Evaluations & Implementations

- In collaboration with the PMO team, we directly implement or configure new applications or significant additions to existing applications. By collecting and vetting user requirements and stories, we determine if an application can support the business process to drive further automation and hours saved.

### Finance Systems Administration

- The team supports Keeping-the-lights-on (KTLO) of the in-scope financial applications. This includes, user provisioning and offboarding, COA segment additions, financial report builds, release upgrade testing, and daily maintenance to ensure the system works as expected. 

### Non-Project Operational Enhancements

- A majority of our time is spent supporting and deploying smaller, non-project-sized tasks that will be prioritized into a milestone.These include adding or updating workflows, custom field enhancements, enabling a quick feature, updating expense policies, etc.

How do I submit a request to your team?

- Projects 

For any requests that will span several weeks, have a cross functional impact, and will require a project manager, please reach out to the PMO team (link){:target="_https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbIFhOYPTQJs9VoGt0Hfc4pofSlnsAR5ftUlSFEL51g/edit#heading=h.eige4lxq05vw"} to get the project on the roadmap and prioritized.
    
- Operational Enhancements 

As most issues require a change to our system to comply with SOX, it must be documented through a **CM: Configuration Change**  template linked here(link){:target="_https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/new#"}. For any new requests, please submit an issue through the template. These issues will be evaluated and assigned to the ~BT:Backlog label(link){:target="_https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=BT%3A%3ABacklog&first_page_size=100"}
