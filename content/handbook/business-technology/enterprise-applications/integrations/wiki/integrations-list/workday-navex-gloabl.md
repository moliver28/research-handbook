# Sequence

```mermaid

 participant Workday
 participant Workato
 participant Google Drive

```

# Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
  "Workday Employee" ||--|| "Navex Employee" : "Maps to"
```

There's not too much data mapping that goes on inside of Workato to get the
employees to match Navex's system. Only a couple of fields with minimal logic.

|Workday Field | Navex Field | Conditional Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FirstName | FirstName | |
| LastName | LastName | |
| | Password | Set via Wokrato |
| Email | Email | |
| JobTitle | JobTitle | |
| GroupCodes | GroupCodes | If `Navex.Department` is `Finance`, `Legal`, `Marketing`, or `Sales`, prepend `Commercial_` |
| CountryId | CountryId | |
| Division | Department | |
| Manager_Name | Manager_Name | |
| Manager_Email | Manager_Email | |

# Error Handling

Needs to be created

# Security Components

1. Workato access Workday data via an authenticated HTTP GET call
2. Workato sends the data to an OAuth authenticated Google Drive for backup
3. Workato sends the CSV file to the SFTP server with username and password authentication
4. Navex reads from the SFTP server using username and password authentication
