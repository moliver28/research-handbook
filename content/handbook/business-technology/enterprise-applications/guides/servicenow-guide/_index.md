## HelpLab Information Guide

#### What is HelpLab?

HelpLab is a GitLab branding of the ServiceNow Platform.

#### What is ServiceNow?

ServiceNow is a SaaS Enterprise Service Management Platform that enables organizations to gain operational efficiencies by centralizing and automating Service Life Cycle Management. Simply put, itâ€™s a Support Ticketing System that will allow us to provide faster and more accurate help so that we maximize the Productivity of our team members.

#### Why ServiceNow?

The solution combines the #people-connect, #stock-admin, #expense-reporting-inquiries, and #payroll and #it_help Slack channels into a single destination. No more searching for the right slack channel for your various questions; you will be able to get the help you need all in one place. 

Additionally, this solution supports our continued emphasis on keeping team members' sensitive information secure and confidential. When you reach out for support, you will know that it's being handled with the utmost care to maintain your privacy.

#### When did it go LIVE?

ServiceNow (aka HelpLab) went live on 2024-04-18.

#### What teams are available in HelpLab?

People Connect, People Tech, Team Member Relations, Stock Admin, Expense, Payroll, and IT services are offered through HelpLab.

#### Tell me more about the HelpLab App?
We are excited to introduce HelpLab App in Slack and help you find pertinent Handbook articles automagically. But wait, there's more! You can even check the status of your recent requests ðŸ¤¯

We want to make getting help easy and fast. We want to get away from having to find the right #slack_channel. We also understand that at times, the help topic might be sensitive. 

Itâ€™s available on-demand just by using the Slack App to contact us. It will help route your question to the right team, check the status of the recent requests, find related Handbook articles, and help create the request so that our experts can follow up.

#### How can I help improve the Handbook Search?
Full transparency. Itâ€™s not, yet, perfect. You can help it improve simply by using it more. If you are the DRI for the HB Articles, help add meta-datas. 

HelpLab leverages AI/ML to correlate your questions with the relevant Handbook article. No more searching the Handbook only having to ask the experts and be 
pointed back to the Handbook article. Our goal is to have the Virtual Agent solve this challenge and help you get the answers you need faster!

#### How do I use ServiceNow?
There are two ways for the current Team Members to use ServiceNow via - (a) the Virtual Agent app in Slack and (b) ServiceNow App in Okta. We recommend using the Virtual Agent App in Slack.
