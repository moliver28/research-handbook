## What is HelpLab

HelpLab is a GitLabâ€™s branding of the ServiceNow Platform.

[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) is a SaaS Enterprise Service Management Platform that enables organizations to gain operational efficiencies by centralizing and automating Service Life Cycle Management. Simply put, itâ€™s a Support Ticketing System that will allow us to provide faster and more accurate help so that we maximize the Productivity of our Teammates.

## Why ServiceNow?

The solution combines the #people-connect, #stock-admin, #expense-reporting-inquiries, and #payroll and #it_help Slack channels into a single destination. No more searching for the right slack channel for your various questions; you will be able to get the help you need all in one place. 

Additionally, this solution supports our continued emphasis on keeping team members' sensitive information secure and confidential. When you reach out for support, you will know that it's being handled with the utmost care to maintain your privacy.

## When is it going to be LIVE?

ServiceNow (aka HelpLab) is going to be live on 2024-04-24.

## Accessing HelpLab

1. Login to your [Okta home page](https://gitlab.okta.com/app/UserHome#).
1. Search for HelpLab in the search bar.
1. Click on the HelpLab button.
   - A new tab should open with your user logged in.

## How do I use ServiceNow?

There are two ways for the current Team Members to use ServiceNow via - (a) the Virtual Agent app in Slack and (b) ServiceNow App in Okta. We recommend using the Virtual Agent App in Slack.

### Create a Ticket / Request in the Portal

1. Log in to HelpLab via Okta.
1. Navigate to the main menu at the top and browse through the menu options to find the team you'd like to request assistance from.

1. Once you've identified the team you need assistance from, look for the topics or categories related to your question or issue.
   - If you're unsure which topic to select, or if your request doesn't fit into any specific category, consider opening a `General Request` available under each team. This option allows you to provide a brief description of your issue or question without selecting a specific topic.
1. Fill in the required details for your request and attach any necessary documents or screenshots to provide additional context.
1. Review your request to ensure accuracy and completeness.
1. Click on the "Submit" button to send your request to the relevant team for processing.

### Add a Team Member to your Ticket / Request in the Portal

After submitting your request, you have the option to add team members, such as your manager, to the watch list. Adding team members to the watch list ensures that they receive notifications and have visibility into the case. This feature is useful if there's anybody who needs to have visibility to the case's progress or if additional stakeholders should be informed about updates or resolutions.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that the watch list functionality is only available via the Portal and not in Slack.

## Tell me more about the HelpLab App?

We are excited to introduce HelpLab App in Slack and help you find pertinent Handbook articles automagically. But wait, there's more! You can even check the status of your recent requests ðŸ¤¯

We want to make getting help easy and fast. We want to get away from having to find the right #slack_channel. We also understand that at times, the help topic might be sensitive. 

Itâ€™s available on-demand just by using the Slack App to contact us. It will help route your question to the right team, check the status of the recent requests, find related Handbook articles, and help create the request so that our experts can follow up.

## How can I help improve the Handbook Search?

Full transparency. Itâ€™s not, yet, perfect. You can help it improve simply by using it more. If you are the DRI for the HB Articles, help add meta-datas. 

HelpLab leverages AI/ML to correlate your questions with the relevant Handbook article. No more searching the Handbook only having to ask the experts and be 
pointed back to the Handbook article. Our goal is to have the Virtual Agent solve this challenge and help you get the answers you need faster!
