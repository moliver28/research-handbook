1. Login to your [Okta home page](https://gitlab.okta.com/app/UserHome#).
1. Search for HelpLab in the search bar.
1. Click on the HelpLab button.
   - A new tab should open with your user logged in.

## How do I use HelpLab?

There are two ways for team members to use HelpLab: 1 - the HelpLab app in Slack and 2 - HelpLab Portal via Okta.

### Create a ticket / request via the HelpLab Portal

1. Log in to HelpLab via Okta.
1. Navigate to the main menu at the top and browse through the menu options to find the team you'd like to request assistance from.

![helplab1](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/servicenow-guide/helplab1.png)

1. Once you've identified the team you need assistance from, look for the topics or categories related to your question or issue.
   - If you're unsure which topic to select, or if your request doesn't fit into any specific category, consider opening a `General Request` available under each team. This option allows you to provide a brief description of your issue or question without selecting a specific topic.
1. Fill in the required details for your request and attach any necessary documents or screenshots to provide additional context.
1. Review your request to ensure accuracy and completeness.
1. Click on the "Submit" button to send your request to the relevant team for processing.

### Add a team member to your ticket / request in the HelpLab Portal

After submitting your request, you have the option to add team members, such as your manager, to the `watch list`. Adding team members to the watch list ensures that they receive notifications and have visibility into the case. This feature is useful if there's anybody who needs to have visibility to the case's progress or if additional stakeholders should be informed about updates or resolutions.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that the watch list functionality is only available via the HelpLab Portal and cannot be used via the Slack app.

### Track & manage open requests via the HelpLab Portal

Navigate to the "My Requests" section.

Here, you will see a list of all your open requests along with their current state and any updates. Click on a specific request to view more details, such as progress updates and comments.

You can also filter by `Open` or `Closed` requests or search for specific requests using the seach bar to quickly locate the request you want to track. If you have submitted a request using the HelpLab app in Slack, you can track its progress here as well.

## How can I help improve the Handbook Search?

Full transparency. Itâ€™s not, yet, perfect. You can help it improve simply by using it more. If you are the DRI for the HB Articles, help add meta-datas. 

HelpLab leverages AI/ML to correlate your questions with the relevant Handbook article. No more searching the Handbook only having to ask the experts and be 
pointed back to the Handbook article. Our goal is to have the Virtual Agent solve this challenge and help you get the answers you need faster!

## HelpLab Support

For immediate support following the launch, for any HelpLab related issues, the best way to reach is by sending a message to the #it_help Slack channel. The dedicated support team will closely monitor this channel and promptly address any problems or questions you may have.
