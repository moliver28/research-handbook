## <i class="fas fa-bullhorn" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Role of IT Business Technology

Our department focuses on managing the framework of how GitLab procures, implements, integrates, secures, exports analytics, and supports our [tech stack applications](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-applications) while providing strategic enablement and integration support for all departments and team members that allows us to scale efficiently, [SAFE](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/)ly, and securely.

## Direction

As we move from Foundation to Scale as an IT organization, we will continue to take a fresh look at how we assess our application landscape and apply our heat map methodology.

The broader Finance and Business Technology team is focused on the principles of Break Down Silos, Be the Solution, Architect and Iterate, and Lead with Data. The IT team also lives by the following philosophy.

## <i class="fas fa-bullhorn" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How We Work

Refer to the [IT PMO](/handbook/business-technology/pmo/) page learn how the IT teams work.

## Business Process Alignment and Enterprise Software Integrations

As new tech stack applications are introduced and/or integrated, our [Enterprise Applications](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/) team helps to align and enable technologies with [end-to-end business processes](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/bsa/) and [custom integrations](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/integrations/) where needed for critical systems, particularly quote-to-cash finance and sales systems.

## Security and Compliance

The [IT Security and Compliance](/handbook/business-technology/it-compliance/) team focuses on reducing the threat landscape and improving our security posture across our tech stack applications while ensuring privacy, data protection, and compliance framework requirements are met. We collaborate closely with the [Engineering Security](/handbook/security/#departmental-structure) department that focuses on the broader scope of the GitLab product and our GitLab.com SaaS offering.

The best practices and policies for team members can be found on the [security practices](/handbook/security/) handbook page.

## IT Support

The IT Support, Engineering, and Infrastructure Management functions have moved to [Corporate Security](/handbook/security/corporate).

## <i class="fas fa-database" id="biz-tech-icons"></i>  Cross-Department System Owners

As GitLab has grown organically, several departments and functional groups have their own System Administrators ("System Owners") to handle day-to-day management of the tech stack applications that are specific to that department or functional group, within the framework of organization-wide compliance, infrastructure, and security best practices.

To support this "shadow IT" model, [each tech stack application](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-applications/) has a System Owner that is the DRI for handling the implementation and day-to-day operational support for the team members that utilize that application (in their department or functional group). This has an added benefit of preventing the traditional IT department from being a bottleneck and allows each department to self-service as part of GitLab's [efficiency for the right group](/handbook/values/#efficiency-for-the-right-group) subvalue.

As a SaaS company, our Engineering division also has an [infrastructure SRE team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/) and [security team](/handbook/security/) that supports the GitLab product development and hosting of our GitLab.com SaaS service. Many of the technologies that we use overlap, so the Business Technology department focuses on the technologies that are used for running the business that usually are not directly related to product development or the hosting of our GitLab.com SaaS service.
