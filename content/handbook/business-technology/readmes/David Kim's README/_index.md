<!-- This template will help you build out your very own GitLab README, a great tool for transparently letting others know what it's like to work with you, and how you prefer to be communicated with. Each section is optional. You can remove those you aren't comfortable filling out, and add sections that are germane to you. -->

### Ennegram Type 3 with 6 Wing

ðŸ”—[**INFP**: Achiever & Loyalist](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/relationship-type-3-with-type-6/)

Surprisingly, this is not a common pairing, although these two types can work very well as a team. On the positive side, Threes bring hard work, optimism, energy, a desire to communicate to and connect with people, and a feeling of unlimited potential both personally and in the relationship itself. Threes can bring an enormous sense of self-confidence and the hope of success that is assuredâ€”that this relationship is a winning team or that this couple is the best ever! Common goals bring them togetherâ€”they are both practical and want to achieve tangible things in the world. 

### What I am Working on

- I contribute as the Product Owner, interfacing with Business DRI for Vision, Roadmap & Strategy
