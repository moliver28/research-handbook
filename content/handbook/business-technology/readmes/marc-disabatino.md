## Marc Di Sabatino's README

### Intro 

Hey! I'm Marc and I'm a [Senior, Business Systems Analyst](/handbook.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/business-system-analyst/#senior-business-systems-analyst) for the [IT Enterprise Applications](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/) division. 

### About me 

I grew up and currently live in Newark, [Delaware](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware) (the first state). I live with my fiance and four cats aka my fur children. I have been working in IT roles and in tech for ten years now. I enjoy the challenges and problem solving opportunities this field provides but what I love most is the opportunity to help people while playing with the latest and greatest tech. 

### My GitLab Story

### What its like working with me

I am very much a product of my [assertive debator](https://www.xpersonalitytest.com/entp/entp-a) personality type. I approach most work situations with a forward looking, out of the box thinking attitude. I will frequently question and challenge ideas and strategies, even if I agree with them. This is not because I am contrarian, it is because I genuinely have an interest into why you think that way and how that idea came to you. I am always looking for my next task to complete and opportunity to improve something. I hold my own personal integrity to highest standard and expect those I work with to do the same. I work best under pressure and enjoy jumping into large or urgent projects but I do need time to focus and complete smaller tasks assigned to me. 

### What I am working on now

Since my change of roles, I am now working on building out the Enterprise Applications Services team along with collaborating on a number of cross divisional projects and goals. 

### Communication with me

I am typically very informal and I like to keep conversations light and friendly. Feel free to message me on Slack, or tag me in a GitLab thread since I typically work from my "To-Do" list. Also feel free to use my Google Calendar Booking link in my Slack profile for any meetings or coffee-chats.
