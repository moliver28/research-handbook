## People Analytics

The People Analytics team at GitLab uses a data-driven approach to support business decisions related to our team members. We collect, analyze, and report data from a variety of sources to provide insights to leaders across the company. You can read more about how the People Analytics and Data teams at GitLab work with people data in the [People Analytics Handbook page](/handbook/people-group/people-ops-tech-analytics/people-analytics/).
