# Process Overview

The Gainsight Data Pump delivers information on key customer usage metrics for both Self-Managed and SaaS customers, and is used by GitLab Customer Success Managers to maximize customer health and encourage product adoption. This document will explain each step required to properly add new metrics to the Gainsight Data Pump.

### Steps

- Step 1: Identify metrics to add to Gainsight
- Step 2a: Check that metrics are being sent for both Self-Managed and SaaS customers
- Step 2b: If necessary, add metrics to SaaS Namespace Service Ping and backfill historical data
- Step 3: Add metrics to seed files, macros, and PREP layer
- Step 4: Cascade metrics through FCT, MART, and RPT layers to workspace models
- Step 5: Cascade metrics to production PUMP models
- Step 6: If necessary, add in Snowplow-based Redis counters to provide tracking for SaaS customers
