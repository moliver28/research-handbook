## Team Member Responsibilities

- Meet with your current manager to discuss the internal opportunity you’d like to pursue prior to submitting your application. If you are not comfortable with having this discussion with your manager, please connect with [your PBP]({{< ref "/handbook/people-group#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division" >}}).
- Ensure you have met your department specific eligibility requirements:
   - Guidelines for performance eligibility:
      - Team members who are assessed at a Performing or Exceeding Performance level during Talent Assessment are eligible to be considered for another role
      - Team members whose Performance is assessed as Developing or are actively undergoing written performance management, may not be eligible. These situations require manager and/or PBP approval to proceed.
      - Team members that have not had a Talent Assessment require manager and/or PBP approval to proceed
   - Time in role eligibility will be 6 months in current role. Exceptions to this:
      - Job Family specialty changes
      - Business Impact  (revenue-dependencies, interim role to perm)
      - Business driven transfers (example of realignments)
      - SDR 12 months in role
- Important things to consider when applying:
   1. Ensure the opportunity aligns with your career goals here at GitLab
   1. Ensure you have discussed compensation and leveling with the recruiter and/or hiring manager for the open role you are interested in and applying for
   1. While you may apply to a role with a higher job grade and title, there may be situations (moving from one job family to another for example) where the higher job grade may not align with your current competencies and skillset that is required for the role. If the hiring team does choose to move forward with an offer, in these cases, it's likely a higher job grade and title will not be given.
- To apply, visit the [internal job openings](https://gitlab.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board). If you are interested in keeping an eye on openings that are posted you can also join the #newvacancy channel in Slack.
- For any questions you have about internal hiring or questions specific to your individual interview process you can either:
   - Create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/internal-hiring/-/issues?sort=created_date&state=opened) in the [hiring process repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/internal-hiring).
   - If a Recruiter has reached out to you, please feel free to reach out directly to them on status updates of your specific process.

- Recruiter will post a job internally following the [req creation process]({{< ref "req-creation" >}}), and the [transfer, promotion guidelines]({{< ref "promotions-transfers#greenhouse" >}}).
- Recruiters will set up notifications for internal applications, to ensure they are notified when internal candidates apply to the role
- Once the Recruiter receives an internal team members application, they will proceed with the following:
   - Review the application as you would with an external candidate and determine if they are qualified for the role. If they are not qualified, please ensure you communicate the decision via email (or slack) and provide clear feedback as to why they are not qualified, and add the hiring manager so they are looped in and can add additional feedback if appropriate.
   - Ensure the internal team members GitLab email is associated with their application. If it is not, then update it as such and notify the team member of this change.

If a team member is not eligible, Recruiter will send the appropriate decline email template.
- Recruiter will then continue the process as described in the [Talent Acquisition Process Framework]({{< ref "talent-acquisition-framework" >}}) for all candidates.
