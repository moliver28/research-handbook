# Solutions Architect Team Regular Calls

While we primarily work [asynchronously](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/), we recognize the value of _intentional_ synchronous communication. These interactions foster collaboration, enhance understanding, and strengthen our professional relationships within the team.

These regular calls serve multiple strategic purposes aligned with our company values:

1. Enhance [transparency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency) by openly sharing information, challenges, and successes across the Solutions Architect team.
2. Facilitate knowledge transfer by exchanging best practices and lessons learned from diverse client engagements.
3. Improve efficiency by reducing duplication of efforts and fostering [collaboration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration) on complex issues.

Here, then, are calls that a Solutions Architect in each team ([Commercial](#commercial), [Enterprise](#enterprise), [Field CTOs](#field-ctos), [Leadership Team](#field-ctos) & [Partner SAs](#partner-sas)) may attend:

#### Notes
<ol>
<li id="note1">
 We should <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#communicating-in-utc">communicate in UTC</a> - but this is quite challenging when daylight savings time is considered (as the UTC time of a meeting will then vary depending on the time of year - even as the local time remains the same). Giving the time in a specific location - with a link to a website (e.g. <a href="https://time.is">timein.is</a>) that will convert that time to a person's local timezone - is seen as the best compromise currently available. 
 </li>
 <li id="note2">
 'Compulsory' in this context means 'attend in person if practical to do so' - but if you cannot, ensure you review the notes document. <b>It is expected that very few calls are given this designation.</b>
 </li>
 </ol>
