## Solutions Architects Onboarding Overview

Onboarding for Solutions Architects is meant to provide newly hired Team Members with information to expedite the process of becoming acclimated to GitLab and the SA role. As a crucial part of the Solutions Architecture team, it is imperative that the new Team Member understands the intricacies of how GitLab's products and solutions work and thus be able to articulate specific use cases and efficiently execute demos.

The purpose of this role-specific onboarding program is to provide the newly hired Solutions Architect (SA) with information to expedite the process of becoming acclimated to GitLab and the SA role. As a crucial part of the Solutions Architecture team, it is imperative that as a new SA, you fully understand the intricacies of how GitLab's products and solutions work. This will enable you to articulate GitLab's Go To Market (GTM) Messaging, apply specific use cases, and efficiently execute demos.

### Introduction

**Welcome to your GitLab Solutions Architects (SA) Onboarding!**

_We are so excited you're here and look forward to setting you up for [all-remote](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) success as your team member journey begins._

Now that you have completed your core GitLab onboarding issue housed in GitLab.com, and Sales Quick Start (SQS) it is time to jump into your [role-based onboarding path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BNxW0n9tr-65IEUbARb0zUZj14atIRURVT1BiuGBD0g/edit). This onboarding program will cover Technical Onboarding as it relates to the SA role. An overview of topics and links covered in your role-based learning path can be found in this [role-specific onboarding guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BNxW0n9tr-65IEUbARb0zUZj14atIRURVT1BiuGBD0g/edit). Please make a copy of this document and check off items as you complete them.

This onboarding still adheres to the sentiments of [self directed and continuous learning](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/), using the diverse set of high and low touch resources available to all GitLab team members such as videos; handbook pages; blog pieces; Zoom sessions and knowledge assessments, while encouraging [asynchronous communication and workflows](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).

### Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since GitLab is a [handbook first](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to any question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available as this is our [Single Source of Truth (SSoT)](/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth).

If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please be sure to reach out to your Manager; Onboarding Buddy; People Connect Team member or the Field Enablement team for support by tagging them in the comments section of this [SA onboarding feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/2635). If you need to troubleshoot specific issues with tools, you can add a screenshot of the issue directly in the comment to help them diagnose the problem.

Alternatively once you are active on [Slack](/handbook/communication/chat), which is used solely for informal communication, you will notice that you have been automatically added to a handful of useful support channels such #questions, #cs-questions, #solutions-architects, #it-help, etc.
