## Solutions Architecture Mission

To drive our customers' success through technical and business consultation.

While using technical and domain-specific expertise, Solutions Architects strive to become [trusted advisors](/handbook/solutions-architects/#trusted-advisors) to our prospects, customers, and partners. Solutions Architects have the following primary objectives:

- Gain a deep technical understanding of our customers biggest challenges, the impacts they have on their business, and collaborate as a strategic partner when determining the most effective solutions
- Deliver impactful value propositions for prospects before they become GitLab customers
- Drive successful adoption of the GitLab platform by our customers
- Grow the business partner ecosystem by developing partner capabilities and building joint solutions

## Role & Responsibilities

### Solutions Architects (Field)

Field [Solutions Architects](/job-families/sales/solutions-architect/) (SA) are the trusted advisors to GitLab prospects and customers during the presales motion. We demonstrate how the GitLab platform and GitLab Professional Services address common and unique business requirements. SA's add value to GitLab's customers by providing subject matter expertise and industry experience throughout the sales process and collaborate internally with product.

In addition, SA's identify and propose comprehensive solutions to complex business problems and workflow scenarios after compiling inputs from customer requests during conversations. Desired inputs include pain points, role-based visibility concerns, opportunities for improved efficiencies, current technologies and tools (3rd party to GitLab) and therefore opportunities to improve integrations, corporate initiatives, target outcomes and more. SA's also act as the technical liaison between the sales team and other groups within GitLab, engaging GitLab employees from other teams as needed in order meet the needs of the customer.

Our Field SA's also engage proactively with existing GitLab customer to provide thought-leadership, engage in innovative solutions, collaborate around evangalism activities around unique customer requirements (i.e. meetups and presentations) and continously seek market feedback to improve the GitLab platform.

### Key Attributes for Positioning Value

As the DRIs helping position, prepare, and guide a customer's technical evaluation the SA team ensure that GitLab can surface the right points of value to the customer's key stakeholders post technical evaluation.  The following embody GitLab's technical evaluation philosophy and help guide successful technical evaluations.

These offerings are delivered each within a specific context of a particular customer journey.

- **Labs / Workshops**: Closed invite, typically in-person events (or a Zoom meetings) providing an exclusive list of customers (typically 1) access to a lab environment, where SAs provide personalized guidance to the customers as questions arise to help them see the value of what they are not currently paying for.
- **Technical Discovery**: A deep dive into current practices at the company that aid in helping identify pain points specific to where GitLab can help address needs and work towards a better long-term state.
- **Demonstrations**: Built around the work done within the technical discovery. Demonstrations aim to address at least 3 specific pain points identified during discovery while selling the vision of GitLab's DevSecOps platform approach.
- **Guided Trials**: Three goals in 30 days through the usage of a GitLab Trial. This can oftentimes be used to replace the need for the more formal Proof of Value.
- **Proofs of Value**: Technical evaluation with more complexities than a Guided Trial. May last up to 8 weeks.
- **Technical Close Plans**: An internal strategy used to secure a technical win for a given opportunity. It leverages the Command Plan and also details the customer's desired business outcomes, notional architectures of the current and proposed states, key stakeholders, and known risks.
