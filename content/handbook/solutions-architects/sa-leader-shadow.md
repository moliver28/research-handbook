## Preparing for the program

### Confidentiality

Participating in the shadow program is a privilege where you will be exposed to confidential information. This is underpinned by trust in the shadows to honor the confidentiality of topics being discussed and information shared. The continuation of this program is entirely dependent on shadows past, present, and future honoring this trust placed in them.

### Consider adding goals

Develop goals for your time as a SA People Leader Shadow. To make your goals more actionable, you may want to use the [SMART goals framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm).

### Coffee chat with SA People Leaders

Before your scheduled rotation, try to schedule coffee chats with as many SA people leaders as possible before you start the program. This gives you the opportunity to get to know them before the rotation.

## During the program

During the program, you will:

1. Experience a "day in the life" of an SA people leader to better gauge interest in pursuing a leadership role in the future
2. Gain greater exposure to GitLab's SA people leaders and their decision making processes
2. Work on developing the [skills required](/job-families/sales/solutions-architect/#manager-solutions-architects-responsibilities) to become an SA people leader
3. Help perform short-term administrative tasks such as taking notes during a meeting and making handbook updates
