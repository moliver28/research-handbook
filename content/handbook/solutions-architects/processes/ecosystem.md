## Engaging an Ecosystem Solutions Architect

To request the assistance of an ESA, reach out to the team in the **#ecosystem-solutions-architects** internal slack channel.  @Mention any of the team to create a thread of 1:1 interaction.  By leveraging this single work queue, we can easily cover for each other and create tracking issues from this channel.  Don’t be surprised if we “move” DMs over to this public channel.

For issues, the ESA team will leverage the **~Partner-SA**, **~Partner Region-AMER|APAC|EMEA**, and **Partner-Acct-<Name>** labels.

## Ecosystem Solutions Architect: Role & Responsibilities

The Ecosystem Team’s north star is GitLab NetARR.  ESAs will support the Ecosystem Sales Managers (ESM) whose main responsibility is to work with field account teams to achieve their revenue goals leveraging partners to scale the quantity, value, and strategic relevance of deals.  

The ESA primary contribution is to help the GitLab Global Ecosystem team drive our sales strategy by empowering an ecosystem of partners with mature GitLab GTM solutions, services practices, and GTM solutions.  The Ecosystem SA role also entails communicating technical concerns of partners back into GitLab Product, Engineering, Marketings and other areas as appropriate. This role involves pre-sales and supporting partners.

### MBO Guidelines

The charter of the Global Ecosystem Team is to develop an ecosystem of partners that can scale the number and size of GitLab opportunities, engage with our customers to ensure rapid and widespread adoption of GitLab licenses, and create GTM solutions that drive mutual revenue growth for GitLab and our partners.  This indirect path to GitLab revenue establishes a need to have an objectives based compensation model for the entire Global Ecosystem Team and ESAs.

25% of the variable Bonus component of ESA compensation, is awarded based on completion of quarterly [SMART Objectives](https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals) (MBO) variously used for prjects and planning throughout GitLab.  Four (or so) quarterly SMART Objectives will be assigned by the Ecosystem SA Manager to each ESA team member.

- The MBOs will vary quarter over quarter, to align to the changing needs of the business
- A balance will be made of consistency of MBOs across the global team vs. recognition of the individual strengths and responsibilities of team members will be made with 2-3 shared MBOs and 1-2 indivualized MBOs
- MBO payout will be a single payment made after the conclusion of the quarter
- The MBO payout will be evaluated as a whole, and the Team Member will be evaluated as:
  - does not meet MBO expectations - 0% of the payment
  - meets some MBO expectations - 75% of the payment
  - meets majority of MBO expectations - 100% of the payment
  - exceeds majority of MBO expectations - 100% of the payment
