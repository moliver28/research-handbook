title: Solutions Architects - Subject Matter Experts
---

The Subject Matter Experts (SME) Program is an initiative designed to help solutions architects (SAs) provide better support to customers. The program will identify and onboard subject matter experts in key areas, such as AI, security, and agile planning.

SMEs are Solutions Architects who will help SAs in their region to answer more-in-depths questions, provide deep technical expertise, and assist with customer demos and presentations when needed.

## Goals

The goals of the SME Program are:

- Provide fellow SAs with the knowledge and expertise they need to support customers effectively.
- Improve the quality of customer support by reducing the number of questions that SAs have to answer.
- Increase customer satisfaction by providing them with access to experts who can answer their questions quickly and accurately.

## Areas of Expertise

The SME Program will initially focus on the following areas:

- AI
- Security
- Agile planning
- Dedicated

Other areas may be added in the future, depending on customer and SA demand, such as:

- GitOps
- MLOps
- Infrastructure

## Responsibilities

SMEs will be responsible for the following:

- **Technical Guidance and Expertise** for the field and/or customer, often in the form of:
  - Opportunity consultations
  - Demo or presentation reviews

  - Common notional architecture diagrams
  - Competitive intelligence
- **Gathering Feedback** from the field to share with product and account teams, such as:

SME DRIs will be responsible for their area of expertise and leading their SME teams.

## Nomination Process

The nomination and selection process for SMEs will be as follows:

1. Open call for applications: SAs interested in becoming SMEs can apply by submitting their areas of expertise and relevant experience. Product Management team is also invited to recommend a nominee.
1. Review of applications: A panel consisting of senior SAs and leadership will review the applications.
1. Selection: The panel will select SMEs based on their areas of expertise and relevant experience.
1. Onboarding: Selected SMEs will undergo a brief onboarding process to familiarize with their new responsibilities and expectations.

## Time Commitment

SMEs are expected to dedicate approximately 10-15% of their time to SME-related activities. This includes:

- Answering questions from other SAs
- Participating in SME/Product meetings
- Developing and delivering training materials
- Staying up-to-date with their area of expertise

The remaining 85-90% of their time will be dedicated to their regular SA responsibilities.

## Recognition and Growth

Being an SME provides opportunities for professional growth and recognition:

- Increased visibility within the organization
- Opportunities to present at internal and external events
- Potential for career advancement
- Recognition in performance reviews

SMEs will be regularly evaluated based on their contributions and impact on the SA team and customer satisfaction.

## Tasks

SMEs will be responsible for the following tasks:

- Answering questions from SAs about their area of expertise. The preferred channel is our [StackOverFlow for Teams](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/#stack-overflow-for-teams).
- Providing technical expertise to SAs during customer demos and presentations.
- Developing and delivering training materials on their area of expertise.
- Staying up-to-date on the latest trends in their area of expertise.
- Participating in field enablement activities.
- Form [communities of practices](/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/communities-of-practice/) among the SMEs for the same topic and with fellow SAs to foster the knowledge in the team.
- Stable counter part in the coresponding [product group](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages)

## Scope

- SME support for an opportunity or an account should be requested by a Primary SA this can include roadmap discussions
- A generalist SA should primarily drive solutions with their broad knowledge. A SME should be consulted ONLY when the generalist SA faces challenges moving forward.
- The existence of SMEs does not guarantee the availability of their engagement.
- The main focus of SMEs are their regular SA responsibilities and then, their assistance as SMEs
- There will be multiple SME per region (EMEA, APAC, US East, US West) but they will be a cross-regional group of SMEs
