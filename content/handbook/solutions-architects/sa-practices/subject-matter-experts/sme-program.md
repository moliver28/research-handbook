title: SME Program Structure, Roles and Responsibilities

description: The Structure of the SME Program, Roles and Responsibilities are detailed here.

--- 

## SME Program Structure

The SME program will be chaired and led by an overall **SME Program Lead,** responsible for establishing and  ensuring that all the SME processes are being adhered to by each SME Area.

The SME Program will consist of one or more [SME Areas of expertise](/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/subject-matter-experts/_index.md), each with a **SME Area Lead/ DRI** responsible for the proper functioning of each area.

As an example there is an AI SME Area Lead, an App Security SME AREA Lead etc.

In total, each SME AREA will consist of

1. An overall SME Area Lead or DRI  
2. At least a Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager representative  
3. At Least 3 SMEs, each selected from each of the following regions: EMEA NEUR, EMEA SEUR, DACH/ META, APAC, US East, US West, Commercial, Partners/Pub Sec)

For the SA Org, There should be only one Subject Matter Expert (SME) representative per region, for each SME Area of expertise, who volunteers to represent their region in the SME program.

Note the Customer Success organization will also have their own SME Area Lead and CS SMEs.

Each SME Area, therefore with both SA and CS Area Leads and all SA and CS SMEs can be referred to as a SME Area Pod.  Each Pod will have their own cadence meetings.

| SME Program Lead |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| SME Area (Pod) |  |
| SA org | CS org |
| SA SME Area Lead | CS SME Area Lead |
| SA Regional SME 1 | CS SME 1 |
| SA Regional SME 2 | CS SME 2 |
| SA Regional SME 3 | CS SME 3 |

While it is highly recommended to have only one SA SME for each area per region, there can exist other subject matter experts (SME) or SME Associates.  The difference being is that there should be one designated regional SME per area who will take on the responsibilities of being a SME DRI in the SME program, including maintaining collateral, gathering feedback from customers, engaging with product management.

## SME Roles

### **SME Associates**

SMEs are expected in general to fulfill two main responsibilities:

* Be experts and maintain a high level of expertise in their area, craft and domain  
* Be the DRI and be responsible for leading and directing various aspects associated with the SME program including, maintaining collateral, gathering feedback from customers, engaging with product management.

However there would be number of SAs (and CSMs) who, as part of their career development, would not desire or are not ready to participate as a DRI in the SME program, but would express interest to focus and go technically deeper in one of the SE Areas: AI, App Security, Agile Planning, Dedicated. 

Think of SME Associates as those potential SMES. who declare a major as they look to advance and graduate in their craft.

These are not the regional SME representatives, who are responsible for leading and directing various aspects of the SME program.

These are SME Associates. There are no limits to number of SAs who can express interest in becoming an expert in any one of the SME Areas.

As an example, an SA manager can encourage all SA team members, in a geography or region, to express interest in having one or more focuses, as a part of their development, to improve their craft in that area.

SME Associates can be mentored by their regional SMEs.

SME Associates can form a pool from which the next Regional SME for a particular area can be selected.

Full Responsibilities for this and other SME roles are detailed [here](\#sme-responsibilities).

### **SMEs (Regional SA representative for each SME Area)**

SMEs are SAs and CSMs who, not only have declared a major, attained recognizable expertise, but who are selected officially to represent a region for a particular SME Area.

SMEs will be responsible for their area of expertise for their region, and to ensure the smooth running of the SME program. 

SMEâ€™s during their tenure in the program must be willing to have the [specified time commitment](/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/subject-matter-experts/#time-commitment)

Full Responsibilities for this and other SME roles are detailed [here](\#sme-responsibilities).

### **SME Area Lead/ DRI**

SME Area Leads/DRIs will be responsible for their area of expertise and leading their SME teams. They are the project managers for their SME Areas.
