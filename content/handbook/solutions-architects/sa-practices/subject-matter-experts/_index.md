title: Solutions Architects - Subject Matter Experts

description: The Subject Matter Experts (SME) Program is an initiative designed to help solutions architects (SAs) provide better support to customers. The program will identify and onboard subject matter experts in key areas, such as AI, security, and agile planning. SMEs are Solutions Architects who will help SAs in their region to answer more-in-depths questions, provide deep technical expertise, and assist with customer demos and presentations when needed.

## Goals

The goals of the SME Program are:

- Provide fellow SAs with the knowledge and expertise they need to support customers effectively.
- Improve the quality of customer support by reducing the number of questions that SAs have to answer.
- Increase customer satisfaction by providing them with access to experts who can answer their questions quickly and accurately.

In order to fulfill the above goals, the [SME Program is structured, appropriately with defined Roles and Responsibilities](/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/subject-matter-experts/sme-program.md), to also support the following processes::

1. [SME Nomination and Onboarding \- How to Become a SME](/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/subject-matter-experts/sme-program/#sme-selectiom)

## Scope

- SME support for an opportunity or an account should be requested by a Primary SA this can include roadmap discussions
- A generalist SA should primarily drive solutions with their broad knowledge. A SME should be consulted ONLY when the generalist SA faces challenges moving forward.
- The existence of SMEs does not guarantee the availability of their engagement.
- The main focus of SMEs are their regular SA responsibilities and then, their assistance as SMEs
- There will be multiple SME per region (EMEA, APAC, US East, US West) but they will be a cross-regional group of SMEs
