title: SME Gather Feedback from Customers 

description: Gather Feedback from Customers

---

### **Customer Feedback Loop**

Gathering and systematically relaying top asks from the field and customers to Product Management and Engineering, is one of the main responsibilities of a SME. This allows a collective view of feedback from the field with analysis, so that it does not always seem reactive, but constructively adds to and builds on a roadmap, with roadmap themes.  The subject matter expert program can share the top ten requests from the field, with predetermined themes/ categories, rather than react individually or just have them go to a issue wasteland. 

1. SAs and CSMs submit customer feedbacks and asks from the field via a process to be determined. (See action items below)  
2. Program SMEs analyze and prioritize the asks via a point system async or on one of their cadence calls.  
3. The top requests are presented and discussed by the Program SME DRIs at the monthly ARR driver meetings  
4. The status of the requests are updated. Updates are relayed back to the Program SME DRIs who then provides updates during a regional SME call (see Cadences below)

### **Customer Feedback Framework and Process**

1. Determine the process by which SAs and CSMs submit customer feedbacks and asks from the field.  
   1. Suggest that there be a slack channel process where SAs can submit customer requests for enhancements, that automatically creates issues based on a predetermined template  
2. Create appropriate templates so that the following is entered with each ask: Customer, Opportunity, Net ARR or ARR basis, Clear Description of Use Case (Current Challenge/ Context, What would a solution look like, What will change if there is a solution), Program Theme/ Sub Category, list of customers who also want this ask.  
3. Need to determine a list of Sub Categories for each Program Area (work with PMs); Eg. AI: Chat, Code Suggestion, Vulnerability Analysis.  
4. Determine a point system based on qualities of the request and assign a point total to each request \<-- This can be automated  
5. SMEs for each Program Area meet sync or async to accept points or override and make it higher or lower priority. They also meet to provide context to Program SME DRIs. This can be twice a month.  
6. Maintain a List of the Top requests  
7. Maintain a Kanban board for each Program Area where each request can be assigned as new, accepted by PM, Added to Roadmap, Resolved, Declined, or placed to Backlog  
8. SME program DIRs meet once a month with PMs to walk through the SME Kanban with PM reps  
9. SMEs for each Program Area can present the Issue Board on their regional SA meetings and get requests verbally then also.  
10. Distinguished between Feature Requests and Bugs/ Enhancements
