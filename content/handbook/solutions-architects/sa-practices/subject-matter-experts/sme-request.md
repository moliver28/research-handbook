To effectively measure the impact and success of the SME program, we will track the following metrics:

1. Technical Win Rate:
   - Metric: Percentage of wins in opportunities with SME involvement
   - Calculation: (Number of won opportunities with SME engagement / Total number of opportunities with SME engagement) * 100
   - Goal: Increase win rate by 10% compared to baseline within 12 months

   - Goal: 15% quarter-over-quarter growth in pipeline value
4. Opportunity Stage Progression:
   - Metric: Percentage of opportunities moving from Stage 2 to Stage 3 and Stage 3 to Stage 4 with SME involvement

   - Goal: Reduce average time to SME engagement by 20% within 6 months
6. Customer Satisfaction:

Reporting and Analysis:

- Generate monthly reports on these metrics to track progress and identify trends
