### How to Request a SME

A system needs to be set up on how to request a SME for an opportunity. One of the responsibilities of a SME is to "Providing technical expertise to SAs during customer demos and presentations via a shared slack channel or joining customer calls."

* SFDC request form (or other)  
* Add SA SME to the opportunity team in SFDC  
* reporting and attribution purposes  
* Agree, request should really only come from the account SA or SA leader

### **SME Slack Channels**

Slack Channels \- Each SME program should have an internal slack channel for all current SMEs and a slack channel where the field can interact with and solicit the services of SMEs and PMs alike. Here is a suggested structure:

* Private SME Channel (Members are SME Program Lead, SME Area Leads and SMEs Only): \#sme-ai-internal, \#sme-security-internal, \#sme-agile-internal, \#sme-dedicated-internal) to facilitate async meetings, discussion on architectural challenges, competition, any enablement needs.  
* SME Field Technical Channel (Members are All SMEs, PMs, and interested SAs, AEs): \#ai-field-technical, \#security-field-technical, \#agile-field-technical, \#dedicated-field-technical. GTM teams can request SME participation, and engage with SMEs in these channels.

### SME Metrics (TBD)

* More technical wins with the areas of SME focus  
  * measure based on SME engagement in activity data  
* Improved bi-directional feedback loop with product  
  * need to track the feedback, and how it's actioned (bidirectionally)

KPIs and Measurements. Need to baseline each of these with historical data, say last 2 years or since the capability was available if more recent than 2 years

* Win rate % (broadly)  
* Win rate % with POV or Tech Eval  
* Increase in pipeline %  
* Increase / improvement in % of opps moving from Stage 2 to Stage 3, or Stage 3 to Stage 4

Need to set some reasonably stretched goals above the baseline to push towards. If win rate % of EAP is 10%, set a goal of 20% within a year. That's a 2x increase in win rate.

Consider an exit criteria for SMEs where the info becomes widely known by SAs at the 300 level. SME domain areas rotate out for new ones that come along over time.

### StackOverflow

I want to make sure that whoever is designated as an SME is listed as such in Stack Overflow. This will ensure that questions tagged with those relevant topics get routed to the right folks.

I would also like it to be a part of the regular rigor that SMEs review questions in Slack (specifically \#cs-questions) and Stack Overflow to ensure the answers are upvoted and relevant as new changes/features get released.

We can also use Stack Overflow for FAQs and Articles related to those particular areas.
