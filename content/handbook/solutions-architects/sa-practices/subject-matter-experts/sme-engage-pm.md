### **Use Case/ Functionality Training/ Beta Programs**

1. Every month there is a GitLab release. At times there is some major new functionality or use case provided that the SAs need be made aware of.  
2. While there can be technical enablement for all SAs, the PMs or TPMs should present changes in architecture, new use cases, features and functionalities to SMEs at least once a quarter to give a first look as it were, obtain feedback or solicit meetings with customers for a beta program  
3. Allow the SMEs to be part of any beta programs also to try and test new functionality  
4. TPMs and PMs should provide demos, or demo snippets to SMEs to demonstrate new functionality for feedback  
5. SMEs can also be involved in the updates or creation of FAQs that can be placed in a handbook  
6. SMEs can guide Demo architects on updates to workshops etc., and help guide SAs on these new features.  
7. SMEs can also present on regional calls any updates or present at their region's quarterlies.
