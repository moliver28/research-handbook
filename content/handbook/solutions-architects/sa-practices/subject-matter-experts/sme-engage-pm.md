## How to Engage with Product Management as a SME (TBD)

TODO:  Need to reveiw the processes in tha handbook with Product Management, and determine hwat updates are needed with the introduction of the SME Program.

1. Review [Customer Issues Prioritization Framework](/handbook/product/product-processes/customer-issues-prioritization-framework/)  
2. How to [Engage Product Managers](/handbook/product/product-management/\#how-to-engage-product-managers)

As an example, SAs should now [request a SME](content/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/subject-matter-experts/sme-request/) for the following scenarios as opposed to always engaging or requesting a Product Manager:

1. Invite SMEs to participate in product discovery sessions and strategy workshops to leverage their domain expertise.
2. Scenario 2
3. Scenario 3

Product Managers can still be engaged to present roadmaps to the customer (TBD)
