## How to Engage with Product Management as a SME (TBD)

TODO:  Need to review the processes in the handbook with Product Management, and determine what updates are needed with the introduction of the SME Program.

1. Review [Customer Issues Prioritization Framework](/handbook/product/product-processes/customer-issues-prioritization-framework/)  
2. How to [Engage Product Managers](/handbook/product/product-management/\#how-to-engage-product-managers)

SMEs should relieve some load on the PMs for the most discussed and impactful product areas by:

1. Delivering product roadmap overviews
2. Delivering deep technical overviews
3. Engaging with customers to gather feedback, better understand what they feel we are missing, or could be doing better
4. Spotting opportunities to expand our product offering in SME areas

Also SMEs can assist Product Management By

1. Participating in product discovery sessions and strategy workshops to leverage their domain expertise.
2. Raising the feedback from the field with the PMs and EMs on a regular cadence
3. Understanding product changes / updates since the last meeting
4. Collaborate in / Create issues to improve the product in the key areas related to the SME area
5. Enabling the rest of the team on the SME area - sharing new insights, updates, learnings, etc. on team calls

SAs should now [request a SME](content/handbook/solutions-architects/sa-practices/subject-matter-experts/sme-request/) for the above scenarios as opposed to always engaging or requesting a Product Manager.

Product Managers can still be engaged to present detail roadmaps to the customer (TBD)
