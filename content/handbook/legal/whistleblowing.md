THIS POLICY WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2021
{.h3}

## PURPOSE

GitLab Inc. (the **“Company”**) is committed to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and
accountability and to complying with applicable laws, rules, and regulations related to its business.
You are required to perform your duties and responsibilities with honesty and integrity and to
comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, as well as Company policies. If you
become aware of an actual or suspected violation of our policies or of any laws or regulations, it
is your responsibility and obligation to report it and you should do so without fear of reprisal or
retaliation of any kind.

We have established this Whistleblower Policy (**“Policy”**) to enable Team Members and other
service providers to report any activity that is unlawful or otherwise violates our policies so that
we can investigate and resolve potential violations as quickly and efficiently as possible.
You are encouraged to use the guidance provided by this Policy to report all known and suspected
improper activities as described below. This Policy is designed to provide each Team Member
with a confidential or anonymous method for reporting any improper activities.

## PERSONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY

This Policy applies to our team members, contractors, consultants, agents, representatives, officers
and members of our Board of Directors (the **“Board”**, and collectively **“Team Members”**).

## WHEN SHOULD VIOLATIONS BE REPORTED

We ask that you follow this Policy to report good faith concerns regarding known or suspected
violations of any of the following:

1. laws, governmental rules or regulations;
1. accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters; or
1. any Company policies (including our [Code of Business Conduct and Ethics]({{< ref "/handbook/legal/gitlab-code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics" >}}).

Keep in mind that your reporting obligation includes complaints or reports you might get from
people outside of the Company and complaints regarding third parties who provide services to us.

## HOW TO REPORT VIOLATIONS

If you believe that any violation has occurred or is occurring or you have a good faith concern
regarding conduct that you reasonably believe may be a violation, you are required to promptly
take one or more of the following steps:

1. Report the known or suspected violation to your manager and/or supervisor.
1. If you would prefer to speak to someone other than your manager or supervisor, you can report
concerns to our Chief Legal Officer, Robin Schulman, at [CLO@gitlab.com](mailto:CLO@gitlab.com).
1. Alternatively, you may report the known or suspected violation confidentially and anonymously by:
    - Calling our EthicsPoint hotline USA toll-free at 1-833-756-0853; or
    - Online at [http://gitlab.ethicspoint.com/](http://gitlab.ethicspoint.com/).

If you report using the above procedures, your report will automatically be directed to our Chief
Legal Officer and the Chair of theAudit Committee(**“Audit Committee”**) of our Board. Human
resources complaints that do not involve accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing
matters or violations of federal or state laws (including securities laws) or any other legal or
compliance violation, will be reported to our People Group Team.

You are encouraged to provide as much detail as possible regarding the subject matter of the
complaint or concern. In order to better respond to any reported concerns, it would be helpful if
you provide your telephone number and other contact information when making the report.
However, if you prefer to remain anonymous, you may report a concern without disclosing your
name or position.

If you wish to report a matter directly to our Audit Committee, you may use the process above, or
you may send an email to the Company’s Corporate Secretary, Robin Schulman
([CLO@gitlab.com](mainto:CLO@gitlab.com) marked “Attention: Audit Committee.” The Audit Committee will take
whatever steps it deems necessary to respond to a report that they receive, including whether to
refer the matter to our Chief Legal Officer for investigation.

## INVESTIGATION

We treat all reports seriously. The Company will promptly review and address each concern as
appropriate. This may involve an investigation conducted by qualified personnel. Investigations
will be conducted confidentially to the extent practical and appropriate under the circumstances,
recognizing that some disclosure may be necessary to effectively investigate the complaint.
You should not conduct your own independent investigation into any suspected violations; instead
make your complaint or report by following the procedures in this Policy. The Chief Legal Officer
will review and coordinate the investigation and resolution of all complaints and reports of a
suspected violation, as well as ensure that corrective action is taken, as necessary and appropriate.

## WE DO NOT RETALIATE AGAINST WHISTLEBLOWERS

We will not tolerate any retaliation against someone who reports actual or suspected violations in
good faith. Any Team Member who engages in retaliatory conduct will be disciplined, up to and
including termination. In some cases, federal, state, and/or local law provides that retaliatory
action for reporting unlawful activity is illegal. Team Members who object to or refuse to
participate in a policy, practice or activity that is unlawful, fraudulent, criminal or incompatible
with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection
of the environment are also protected from retaliatory action.

We do not permit any form of intimidation or retaliation by any Team Member, contractor,
subcontractor or agent of the Company against you because of any lawful act done to:

1. provide information or otherwise assist in an investigation of conduct you reasonably believe
is a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or of any Company policy; or
1. testify, participate in or otherwise assist in a proceeding filed or to be filed relating to a

violation of any law, rule or regulation.
Nothing in this Policy in any way prohibits or is intended to restrict or impede Team Members
from discussing the terms and conditions of their employment with co-workers or union
representatives/exercising protected rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations
Act/exercising protected rights to the extent that such rights cannot be waived by agreement, or
otherwise disclosing information as permitted by law.

## CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

Our Board reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify or grant waivers to this Policy. Any
amendments or waiver may be publicly disclosed if required by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.
