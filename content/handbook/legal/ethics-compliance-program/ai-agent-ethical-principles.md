title: "GitLab Duo Workflow Agent Ethical Principles"
---

GitLab is committed to developing the Duo Workflow Agent system responsibly and ethically. These principles guide our approach to AI-powered workflow automation within our DevSecOps platform.

## 1. User Control and Transparency

- Always obtain explicit user consent before initiating workflows or executing commands
- Provide clear information on agent actions and decision-making processes
- Allow users to approve, modify, or cancel workflows at any stage

GitLab believes in empowering users and maintaining transparency in all AI-driven workflows. We strive to ensure users have full control over the Duo Workflow Agent's processes and understand how decisions are being made throughout the automation pipeline.

## 2. Safety and Security

- Implement strong security measures to protect user data and code
- Place appropriate limits on the agent's autonomy and capabilities
- Maintain human oversight and enable intervention for high-stakes tasks

Security is paramount in our DevSecOps approach. We apply this rigor to the Duo Workflow Agent, ensuring it enhances rather than compromises the safety and integrity of user systems, data, and code repositories.

## 3. Ethical and Responsible Use

- Design the system to encourage ethical software development practices
- Actively monitor for and mitigate potential biases in training data and decision-making
- Respect intellectual property rights and optimize for energy efficiency

GitLab is committed to promoting responsible AI use that aligns with our CREDIT values. We strive to develop the Duo Workflow Agent to benefit users and improve software development processes while minimizing potential harms and environmental impact.

## Implementation Guidelines

To uphold these principles, we will:

- Implement a robust sandboxing mechanism for the Duo Workflow Executor
- Provide clear logs and explanations for each step in automated workflows
- Enable user intervention at any point during workflow execution
- Regularly audit the system for potential biases or security vulnerabilities
- Establish clear accountability structures for agent actions
- Continuously gather and incorporate user feedback to improve the system

## Continuous Improvement

As with all aspects of GitLab, we believe in iteration and continuous improvement. These principles will evolve as we learn and grow in our development of the Duo Workflow Agent. We welcome feedback from our community to help refine and enhance our ethical AI practices in workflow automation.
