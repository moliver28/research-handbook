Hi! I'm Rachel (RAY-chul) and I'm GitLab's Director of Ethics and Compliance ("E&C"). This ReadMe exists to help you understand who I am as a person, what I do at GitLab, and how I like to collaborate. 

### About Me

I'm born and raised in Michigan and although I began my career in litigation, I eventually discovered my true passion - ethics and compliance - and that's what I've been doing for over ten years. When I'm not working, I like to hang out with my husband and two kids, cook, read, and travel as much as we can (with the kids, when I'm feeling brave).

### My Background & Role at GitLab

In the decade + that I've been working in the E&C space, I've focused on different compliance areas and worked for employers in different industries, and I've been really fortunate to work with good people who care about conducting business ethically. Here at GitLab, my role involves:
- Monitoring the regulatory landscape for changes that might have an impact on GitLab's business operations;
- Making sure GitLab has policies, procedures, and processes needed to comply with applicable regulations;
- Providing training and other resources so that team members are aware of and understand those regulations and policies;
- Leveraging technical controls to compliment and enforce our policies, whenever that makes sense; and,
- Monitoring the effectiveness of this program and related controls.  

### My Style

Ethics and compliance works best when everyone is transparent about and collaboratees closely to address weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. This attitude benefits everyone and yields better results, so I really try hard to be approachable, open-minded, and solution-oriented. I am not fussy about communication, so everyone should feel comfortable contacting me in whatever way feels right for the circumstances, whether that is through #ethics-and-compliance, private message, or email. Do not hesitate to follow up with me for urgent matters.
