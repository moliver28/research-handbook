## The Assigned Support Engineer offering

An Assigned Support Engineer (ASE) is a senior level support engineer who leads
our support delivery for one to four accounts. The ASE strives to:

- develop excellent relationships with their main contacts at each account
- understand each account's GitLab environment, architecture and use cases
- be a trusted advisor to each account in order to guide them through tickets,
  upgrades and other situations efficiently and smoothly
- be available to work with their customers through tickets, issues and video
  calls during business hours
- be aware of all tickets submitted by each of their accounts, and lead as many
  of those as they can within the amount of time allotted in the contracts

By taking a personalized, customized approach to serving each account, the ASE
has the opportunity to ensure that these important customers are happy and
successful with GitLab.

For the official description of this offering, see the [Assigned Support Engineer
Delivery Data Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-GDQV9wZkTvTTMqIPw1mSLaeVUru4zU/view).
