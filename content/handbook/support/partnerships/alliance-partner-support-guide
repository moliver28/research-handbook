## General info

### Alliance Partner Slack channel

We share a Slack channel with the Alliance Partner Support team. These are named #a_[Alliance Partner name]. This is a good place to engage with their Support team directly for questions and collaboration. If the topic is a specific ticket, do include the Partner ticket id.

### Regular touch points

We have regular meetings with our Alliance Partners' support team, to ensure collaboration works well and customers receive stellar support. Reach out to the [Alliance partner DRI](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/support/alliance-partners/#gitlab-contacts) to get topics on the agenda.

### ZenDesk organization

Do not add anyone to Alliance Partner ZenDesk organizations. Reach out to [contacts above](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/support/alliance-partners/#gitlab-contacts) if needed.

## Alliance Partner Support collaboration

Alliance Partners at GitLab may also have a Support collaboration with GitLab, for our shared customers. Shared customers have purchased both Alliance Partner product and GitLab product. All customers have Ultimate licenses.

Support collaboration means that for GitLab related tickets, our Alliance Partner does 1st level support and hands over tickets to GitLab for 2nd and 3rd level Support.

Most things work just as any other customer, but there are some differences listed below.

### Ticket customer

Tickets are created by the Support team at the partner, but the tickets come from many different individual customers. The opinions and issues brought up in tickets are the customers', not an expression of our Alliance Partners views.

Ticket content is copied verbatim from our Alliance Partners ticket system, to ours.

Customers in the tickets are GitLab customers, just as much as they are Alliance Partner customers.

### Adding customer to ticket

Alliance Partner support team needs to add customer as cc when they create the ticket. Just as with any other customer, GitLab should not add any contacts to the ticket.

### Support Process differences

Be mindful that GitLab support process may differ from how the support team works at an Alliance Partner and always [assume positive intent](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent). 

Also note that specific partners can have [special processes](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/support/alliance-partners/#specific-alliance-partners) (GitLab internal link, only team members can access).

### Scope

Alliance partner does initial ticket triage and 1st level support. GitLab Support are responsible for 2nd and 3rd level support.

### Ticket priority

Alliance partner triages tickets and set the initial ticket priority. GitLab support will assume the ticket priority is appropriately set in our initial response.

If the priority changes at a later point in time or we find the priority should be adjusted, we will clarify with customer in the ticket and change priority [per our normal process](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/setting_ticket_priority/#resetting-ticket-priority).

### Customer calls

Do add relevant Alliance Partner support engineers to customer calls.
