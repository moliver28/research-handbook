## Advanced Search

Advanced Search is an app that provides a simple visual interface for
constructing complex search queries against tickets, users, and organizations
(orgs). It also enables you to export the search results in a CSV format.

App information:

- Located in the navbar
- This application was developed by
  [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/partners/zendesk/) and is
  available in the
  [Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/advanced-search/).

## Architecture Diagrams

<sup>*Introduced via [support-ops-project#801](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project/-/issues/801)*</sup>

This app uses the Organization field `AM Project ID` to check for an existing
Account Management project. If it finds it, it will then link to that
projectâ€™s Architecture Diagram.

**NOTE**: The AM Project ID field is manually populated. To get that added in,
you would want to submit a Support Ops Project issue.

App information:

- Located in the ticket sidebar
- This application was developed in-house and can be found
  [GitLab Architecture project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-support-readiness/zendesk-us-government/apps/gitlab-architecture).

## GitLab Reminders App

<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#3036](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/3036)*</sup>

The Reminders App appears in the navbar and allows the agent a more specialized
view of tickets they are involved in. It currently shows:

- Tickets assigned to you with a pending/overdue task that are not in a Closed
  state
- Recent tickets you have viewed
- Tickets assigned to you that are not in a Closed state
- Tickets you are CC'd on that are not in a Closed state

It also allows you to quickly manage your tasks by seeing the notes you have
left for said task, when it is due, and a button to quickly mark the task as
done (remove the notes and due date).

how they were solved.

<sup>*Introduced via [support-ops-project#801](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project/-/issues/801)*</sup>

A plugin controlled app that can do several things Zendesk related

The current plugins are:

- **Create new ticket**
  > Allows an agent to create a new ticket using the same user as the ticket they are currently on.
- **Due date picker**
  > This allows you to customize what the Due Date for a Task ticket is set for. By default, Zendesk only allows setting the date. This enables you to set the date, time, and timezone.
  >
  > You can also set the Due Date Note and disable (or enable) task notifications using this app.
- **Escalated tickets**
  > This searches for tickets under the organization that have been escalated within the last 6 months.
- **Related tickets**
  > This looks for tickets related to the current one based off the category (or subcategory) the ticket is currently using. It then displays up to 5 of them (sorted by the update_at value of the ticket, descending).
- **Attachments**
  > Displays attachments present on the ticket.
