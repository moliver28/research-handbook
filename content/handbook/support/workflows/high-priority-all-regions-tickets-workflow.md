description: How to work on High Priority All-Region Tickets
---

The High-Priority All-Region (`HPAR`) ticket handling process has been deprecated. The actual need
for coordinated round-the-clock effort on a ticket is infrequent enough that it can be handled by
exception.

If a customer requests for round-the-clock attention on a ticket, or if you feel such attention
would be beneficial to deliver results for a customer, please raise a [Support Ticket Attention Request](/handbook/support/internal-support/support-ticket-attention-requests/)
to start a discussion with the Support Manager On-Call.
