title: ASE Emergency Workflow
category: Assigned Support Engineer
description: Workflow for an ASE when their account submits an emergency
---

An account can submit an emergency either [while you're working](#during-work-hours)
or [when you're off](#after-work-hours), each of which have subtle
differences.

In either case, it is important to note that **you are not constantly on-call**
and, thus, are not required to take the emergency unless you're the on-call
engineer. However, at times like these it is important to remember
[the purpose of your role](ase_purpose.md) so the customer gets a good
experience without sacrificing your sanity.

## ASE is available

- page normal on-call procedure
- on-call engineer takes call, like normal
- ping ASE in emergency Slack thread so they can catch up
- join to help if you can; otherwise, help async
- after emergency, ASE owns ticket if ticket continuation is needed

## ASE is unavailable

- page normal on-call procedure
- on-call engineer takes call, like normal
- ping ASE in emergency Slack thread so they can catch up
- after emergency, ASE owns ticket if ticket continuation is needed
- if needed, ASE should contact on-call engineer to get any required details

### Being proactive

- be proactive to summarize important details before the emergency
- good when customer is doing after-hours work, such as upgrades or migrations
