title: ASE Emergency Workflow
category: Assigned Support Engineer
description: Workflow for an ASE when their account submits an emergency
---

An account with an Assigned Support Engineer (ASE) can submit an emergency
either [while you're available](#when-available)
or [when you're not](#when-unavailable).

In either case, it is important to note that you are not permanently on-call
and, thus, are **not required** to take the emergency unless you're the on-call
engineer. However, at times like these it is important to remember
that you are still the Support Engineer with the most context of the
customer's situation & objectives, so may be able to point the problem towards
a successful outcome. A little of your aid can go a long way towards getting
things back on track.

## Process for the on-call engineer

Regardless of when it comes in, the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/)
for the emergency continues to be the on-call Support Engineer.
Their only process change is that they should **notify the ASE of it**.
This can be done by pinging the ASE's Slack handle in the Slack thread where the
emergency is being discussed.

Once an emergency comes in, the on-call engineer creates its Slack thread,
and notifies the ASE of what's going on, then the on-call engineer can continue
working with the customer as they would any other.

## Process for the ASE

### When available

If the on-call engineer notifies you of an emergency and you are either
available or can be available, then work alongside the on-call engineer to
resolve the ticket. This may involve *any* of the following:

- Taking over as
  [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) for the emergency
- Shadowing the emergency for any amount of time
- Troubleshooting the emergency in Slack, asynchronously
- Updating the on-call engineer with any required context

You don't have to take over the emergency if you aren't able to, but can
provide the on-call engineer with the information they need that can help lead
the emergency towards a successful outcome.

### When unavailable

If you come back to work and see that an emergency took place while you
weren't available, then catch up on what happened and reach out to the
customer to discuss any next steps.

If a big project is planned while you know you'll be unavailable, see
[be proactive](#be-proactive).

### Be proactive

If a project is planned after-hours that may lead to an emergency (an upcoming upgrade,
migration, etc.) then it would be beneficial to create a summary
of what's planned, possible problems that may arise, and suggested solutions.
Any other useful information that can be used to troubleshoot (architecture
info, problems, etc.) would be beneficial. Leave this as an internal note in the
ticket so the on-call engineer can see it.
