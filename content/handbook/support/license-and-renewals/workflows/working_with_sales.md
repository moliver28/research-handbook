The "Working with Sales" workflows are essential for delivering exquisite service and maintaining seamless customer hospitality at GitLab. These workflows provide a structured approach for Support team members to handle various customer account scenarios, ensuring efficient and transparent collaboration with the Sales team. By following these workflows, our teams:

1. Ensure consistent and professional customer interactions, embodying customer hospitality
2. Maintain clear boundaries between Support and Sales responsibilities
3. Facilitate efficient escalation processes when necessary
4. Minimize delays in addressing customer needs, a key aspect of exquisite service
5. Promote accountability across teams
6. Support data integrity in our CRM and ticketing systems

Being guided by these workflows helps GitLab deliver high-quality service, maintain customer satisfaction, and optimize internal processes, ultimately contributing to the company's growth and success. This commitment to excellence is a hallmark of our [high performing teams](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-development/high-performing-teams/).

## General 4-Step Workflow Summary

Regardless of the account role, each workflow follows a general four-step process designed to ensure exquisite service delivery:

1. Initial Response: 
    - Respond to the customer on Zendesk with a focus on customer hospitality
    - Assign the ticket and update its status
2. Internal Communication: 
    - Notify the appropriate Sales team member or group
    - Provide relevant details about the customer's request
3. Follow-up:
    - Monitor the response from Sales
    - Update the customer on the next steps, maintaining our commitment to exquisite service
4. Escalation (if necessary):
    - Follow the defined escalation path if timely action is not taken
    - Involve higher levels of management as needed

These steps ensure that customer inquiries are handled promptly and with 
the utmost care, the right internal stakeholders are involved, and there's 
a clear path for resolution or escalation when required. While the specifics 
may vary depending on the account role, this general structure provides a 
consistent approach to managing customer interactions and internal processes, 
reflecting the standards of our high performing teams.

## Customer Account Roles
Understanding the different customer account roles is crucial for providing tailored support and ensuring efficient collaboration between Support and Sales teams. Here's an overview of the main account roles:

1. Named Account Owner:
   - Typically assigned to large enterprise customers or strategic accounts
   - These accounts have a dedicated Account Executive or Customer Success Manager
   - Requires a more personalized approach and direct communication with the assigned sales representative
2. AMER|EMEA|APAC SMB Sales User:
   - Represents small and medium-sized businesses in specific geographic regions (Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa, or Asia-Pacific)
   - Managed by regional SMB sales teams
   - May require coordination with regional sales representatives or SMB advocate teams
3. Other (non-person) Account Owner:
   - Accounts that don't fall into the above categories or have a specific individual assigned
   - May include general or unassigned accounts
   - Requires identifying the appropriate sales segment and territory owner for escalation

## Workflow by Account Role

Each role type has a tailored workflow to ensure that customers receive the most appropriate and efficient support, whether they're a large enterprise with a dedicated account manager, a small business in a specific region, or an account that requires a more generalized approach.

### 1. Named Account Owner Workflow
1. Respond to the customer on Zendesk:
   - Assign the ticket to yourself
   - Check the "Escalated to sales" box
   - Set ticket status to "Open", then "Pending"
   - If the account is owned by AMER|EMEA|APAC SMB Sales User, inform the 
   customer they may email smallbusiness@gitlab.com directly
2. Leave a message for the Account Owner on Chatter:
   - Include relevant details and expected response time (24 hours, excluding 
   weekends, Family and Friends Day & global holidays)
   - Share the Chatter message link in an internal ticket note
   - Consider checking the account owner's Slack status for availability
3. When Sales confirms contact with the customer:
   - Update the ticket with the contact person's name
   - Mention a 2-day follow-up to check if the customer has been contacted
   - Set ticket status to "Pending"
4. Escalation procedure (if necessary):
   - Check account's Salesforce "Activity" section for recent outreach
   - If no response after 24 hours, mention the account owner's manager in Chatter
   - Escalate to higher management levels every 24 hours, up to CEO if needed
   - Use the company organization chart for escalation hierarchy

### 2. AMER|EMEA|APAC SMB Sales User Workflow

## Determining whether to pass or NOT pass to Sales
*Summary*: Deciding whether to pass a customer inquiry to Sales depends on the complexity of the request and whether it requires Sales' expertise. Generally, pass to Sales for complex purchasing scenarios, but handle simpler inquiries and self-service options within Support.

### DO NOT pass to Sales

1. Plan Upgrades
    - *Responsibility*: Guide customers to use the upgrade button in the customer portal for SaaS or self-managed plan upgrades.
    - *Rationale*: This is a self-service option that doesn't require Sales involvement.
2. Unclear Customer Needs
    - *Responsibility*: Clarify the customer's requirements before considering escalation.
    - *Rationale*: Ensures efficient use of resources and prevents unnecessary escalations.
3. Renewal Assistance
    - *Responsibility*: Assist customers with renewal inquiries if they haven't received a response from Sales.
    - *Rationale*: Provides timely customer service and may resolve issues without Sales involvement.
4. Product or Process Questions
    - *Responsibility*: Answer these queries or route to appropriate Support queue.
    - *Rationale*: Utilizes Support's expertise and keeps Sales focused on sales-specific tasks.
5. User Addition After Renewal
    - *Responsibility*: Direct customers to use the "Add more seats" button in the customer portal.
    - *Rationale*: Encourages self-service and doesn't require Sales expertise.
6. Seat Reduction at Renewal
    - *Responsibility*: Guide customers on the process to reduce seats, including disabling automatic renewal and manual renewal steps.
    - *Rationale*: This process is standardized and doesn't typically require Sales intervention.

*Note*: Sales does not automatically waive true-ups. There's an approval process for exceptional cases. Avoid setting expectations about fee waivers. When in doubt, consult Slack for a second opinion.

## Support responsibilities regarding True-Up waiver requests

In situations involving True-Up waiver requests, L&R Support can:

- Help customers and/or sales identify if a True-Up overage has occurred.
- Generate a requested license based on what the subscription allows.
- Generate a temporary license or subscription until a True-Up waiver request is resolved.

L&R Support cannot:

- Provide an in-depth explanation as why an overage has occurred, support can only collate the data that proves whether an overage has occurred or not.
- Provide detailed analysis on the nature of the overage (e.g. confirm if overage accounts were logged into or not, confirm how and when accounts were created or provide a timeline of the duration of any overages, etc.)
- Be the arbiter for whether a True-Up can be waived or not; this is the responsibility of Sales as detailed in [waived true-ups policy and approval requirements](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#waived-true-ups-policy-and-approval-requirements).

## Specific workflows to pass to Sales

Many of the following workflows advise you to `Chatter Sales`.  How to do this
is described in the [expired license](/handbook/support/workflows/sla_and_views#handling-customers-with-incorrect-expired-support)
process.

The following workflows use the [Pass to Sales Zendesk macro](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/admin/macros/360025924680)
unless otherwise stated.
### Pass to Sales

2. Sales-assisted purchases requiring order forms: customer had a sales-assisted purchase last year and wants to purchase on an order form (company requires a quote or purchase order)
3. Reseller-involved purchases: purchase needs to happen through a reseller (reseller or end user contacts us)

### Customer wishes to use alternative payment method

*Summary*: Handle requests for non-credit card payment methods by confirming details and involving Sales.

1. Assess subscription timeline:
    1. For near-expiry subscriptions, advise letting it expire and purchasing new
    1. For new subscriptions, explore refund possibilities
    1. If neither of the above options is suitable:
        - Chatter Sales with a summary of the customer's request
        - Specify the number of seats needed for the new product
        - Ask Sales to reach out with a transfer quote
2. Respond to the customer using the appropriate macro
