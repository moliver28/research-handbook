## Goal

The Release Artifacts Working Group aims to create a new ubiqutious standard/spec to describe release artifacts within and outside of GitLab.

### Overview

We [identified](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/12815#note_1651889363) a large market opportunity with our financial customers. These customers require [a release artifact](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/delivery/glossary.html#release-artifact) that is worked on throughout the release process with specific parts being frozen after certain steps in the process.

> Think like an auditor (quote from a GitLab customer)

Today, no single tool provides or specification exists to describe a release artifact with strong auditing requirements. There are solutions for cloud native application delivery (CNAB, Terraform, Helm, Radar), but these tools don't include the scope of the approval process and auditing.

### Goals

- Create a specification for a new standard that we can donate to the CNCF
- Create a plan to implement the specification within GitLab

### Exit Criteria

The table below lists all exit criteria for the working group. See the top-level epic (TBD) for more details.
