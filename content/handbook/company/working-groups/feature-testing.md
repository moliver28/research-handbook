### Context

The current approach to feature testing, using RSpec and Capybara, has a number of drawbacks:

* Feature suite provides limited confidence in code changes, fails to catch regressions.
* Low level of stability leads to high frequency of broken master.
* Limited debugging tools make it difficult to create stable tests and debug flaky ones.
* Maintenance of tests written in Ruby is the responsibility of Frontend engineers, who may or may not have skill in this language.

### Goals

This Working Group has the following goals:

1. Establish the credibility of an alternative testing system, such as Playwright, as an alternative to RSpec / Capybara.
    1. This may involve one or more Proof-of-Concepts (PoC)
    1. May be deployed on a relatively isolated surface area, with limited test coverage or a high proportion of quarantined tests
1. Improved developer documentation or tooling that might result from this investigation
