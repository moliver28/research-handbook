## Purpose

At most companies, this would be a quarterly meeting for senior function leaders to present priorities, progress, and risk mitigations to the CEO. We allow some additional stakeholders to attend to invite a broader range of perspectives, give visibility to peers across functions, and create broader accountability.

Members of [E-Group](/handbook/company/structure/#executives) and department leaders nominated by their E-Group leader can be required or optional. Their E-Group member will determine desired participation from within their function.

These meetings are designed to ensure that the CEO and function are aligned on:

1. Quarter-to-quarter variances.
1. Performance against the plan, forecast, and operating model.
1. Connection between OKRs and KPIs.
1. Progress against Yearlies and OKRs.
1. Accountability to the rest of the company.

## Key Metrics

1. [KPIs](/handbook/company/kpis/) of that function or department.
1. [OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/) for that function.

## Timing

Key Reviews are once per quarter.

## Scheduling

The Staff EBA to the CFO is the scheduling DRI for the Key Reviews and will schedule a four hour block during the week after [Sales QBRs](../sales/qbrs/index.md).
They will break up the block into 8 blocks of 25 minutes each (one for each function) and invite relevant attendees to each session. 

The Key Review meeting invitations will utilize the CFO's Zoom account. The functional DRI and corresponding EBA will be set as co-hosts. The Key Reviews should always be recorded, with the functional DRI's EBA as the recording DRI.

A Key Review should not be cancelled without permission. Permission to cancel or make changes to the Key Review schedule must be requested in the [#key-review](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CPQT0TRFX) Slack channel, tagging the CFO for approval and the Staff EBA to the CFO for awareness. If the CFO is not available, the CEO will make the decision. All changes to the Key Review schedule and/or invites have to be posted in the [#key-review](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CPQT0TRFX) Slack channel.

## Invitees

Required invitees are members of E-Group, the CoS to the CEO, the EBA to the CFO, and the EBAs to the CEO.
Optional attendees are other team members as designated by their E-Group leader.

Key Review Meetings may contain MNPI. As materials are limited access, participation is limited. Key Review agendas and recordings should not be shared with anyone not on the invite. If the Key Review Meeting contains MNPI, verify everyone on the Zoom call is permitted to be exposed to that MNPI and ask those who are not permitted to disconnect - do not share MNPI until confirming that everyone in the meeting should have access to what is being discussed. Key Review meetings that contain MNPI must not be privately livestreamed to GitLab Unfiltered.

If the Key Review meeting will not contain MNPI, it can be privately livestreamed to GitLab Unfiltered.

Functions that have these quarterly meetings are:

1. Sales (Chris Weber - function DRI)
1. Marketing & Strategy (Ashley Kramer - function DRI)
1. People Group (Rob Allen - function DRI)
1. Finance (Brian Robins - function DRI)
1. Product (David DeSanto - function DRI)
1. Legal and Corporate Affairs (Robin Schulman - function DRI)
1. Security (Josh Lemos - function DRI)
1. Engineering (Sabrina Farmer - function DRI)

Function DRIs are expected to review the invite list in advance of each Key Review. If cross-functional topics are being discussed, they are encouraged to invite folks who should be involved in the conversation. If there are MNPI concerns, they may choose to link to a separate agenda for this part of the discussion.

If you would like to be added to a function's Key Review, ask your functional E-Group member to ask the Staff EBA to the CFO to add you.

## Meeting Format

We encourage each group to conform to this simple [company-wide template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1esfS19XLcVDQnEd8iBZJM_FXKJXE2NR8aRNqBYj8hCc/edit#slide=id.g278553b265c_0_3) as much as possible to reduce duplicative efforts and streamline Key Reviews. Each Key Review presentation should aim to cover the following areas:

1. **Functional Performance:** quarterly performance and insights from the quarter. Topics include:
     1. Comparisons against Plan, Forecast, benchmarks, or prior quarter / year
     1. What is most important for other cross-functional leaders to know: discussion topics where help or visibility is needed, callouts of dependencies on other groups and risks
     1. Top 3 priorities the department is actioning
1. **Yearlies and OKRs:** progress update - include scoring, next steps if incomplete
     1. OKRs that map directly to Yearlies
     1. OKR for non-Yearly OKRs, if relevant
1. **Upcoming OKR goals:** mapped as appropriate to Yearlies
1. **Other additional topics:** topics not covered by slides above, and relevant to the organization
