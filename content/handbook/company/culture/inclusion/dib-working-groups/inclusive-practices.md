title: "Inclusive Practices"
description: "Inclusive practices in a remote work environment are those that make employees feel valued, respected, and welcomed, regardless of their background, identity, or work arrangement. Inclusive workplaces celebrate diversity and acknowledge how differences contribute to the organization's culture and business outcomes. They also strive to make employees feel comfortable asking for what they need, and understand that people have different ways of processing information, interacting with others, and achieving goals.

What Is an Inclusive Workplace? Definition and Best Practices
Aug 25, 2023 — Over to You. What Is an Inclusive Workplace? An inclusive workplace is defined as a work environment that makes every employee feel valued while also acknowledging their differences and how these differences contribute to the organization's culture and business outcomes. An inclusive workplace is characterized by affirmative action, wherein any impact of bias/discrimination/unequal opportunity is negated. As you can see from this definition, an inclusive workplace celebrates diversity and its role in the organizational fabric. These companies do not pretend that everyone enjoys an equal footing or a level playing field.

It goes beyond just diversity. Rather, inclusivity means having a workplace culture where every individual feels valued, respected, and welcomed, regardless of their background, identity, or work arrangement. However, promoting inclusivity in a hybrid work setup presents unique challenges. First and foremost, there can be disparities in opportunities between on-site and remote employees. In-office workers might have more visibility and access to networking opportunities, while remote employees may struggle to gain recognition and promotions. Bridging this gap requires intentional efforts to ensure equal opportunities for all.
