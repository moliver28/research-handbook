## Mission

Increase awareness to GitLab’s globally diverse team, the derivatives of having a global team as it relates to the wider GitLab team as well as the company, and improve the daily work life of our global team members.

## Objectives

The Global Voices TMRG has determined the three main objectives to generate impact on in order to fulfill our mission:

1. Empower global team members to celebrate global representation and its benefits
1. Serve as a springboard for ideas to improve global inclusiveness to the day-to-day of GitLab employees
1. Advocate for global diversity across the organization

## Current Goals

With our mission and objectives in mind, we are taking a goal-oriented approach to iterative improvement. We've decided to work on a rough 6 month horizon, defining goals we'd like to target with that timeframe. For the current active horizon we'll be focusing on two:

1. [Focused on global recruiting and retainment of team members](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1939)
   1. Of our three objectives, this one helps address two of them and we think is a fundamental part of having a globally diverse team.
   1. It is larger in scope and will likely involve more collaboration and cross-functional discussions on how we can help drive progress with this goal. Iteration will be key to making sure there’s focus and fulfillment.
   1. This will likely require 2-3 people that are interested in exploring the topic and leading it.
1. [Focus on the daily life as a global team member](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1943)
   1. This will be made up of several specific initiatives where a solution is more visible and attainable. We need to determine what these will be but are thinking of 2-4 small initiatives here.
   1. These will likely short term and could easily be led by a single team member.
   1. We encourage and welcome new initiatives team members are interested in.
