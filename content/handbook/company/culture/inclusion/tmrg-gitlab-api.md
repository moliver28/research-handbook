This TMRG is non-exclusionary in nature and open to anyone at GitLab.

## Mission

“To promote the advancement, cultural awareness, talent recruitment, retention, and professional development for API individuals by giving a voice to the diverse backgrounds of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities within GitLab in order to ensure the GitLab messaging continues to reflect its core value of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.”
