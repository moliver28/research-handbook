# Compliance Frameworks

This blueprint serves as living documentation of the technical considerations in the implementation of [Compliance Frameworks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_frameworks.html). This includes functionality in [Compliance Center](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_center/) and the relationship with [Security Policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/).

## Proposal

Outline how compliance enforcement and visibility will be handled through Compliance Frameworks as an evolution from [Compliance Standards Adherence](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_center/compliance_standards_adherence_dashboard.html).

## Motivation

There are three main parts to compliance posture of a customer Enforcement, Visibility, and History.

### Enforcement

Enforcement within GitLab is currently done through [Security Policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/) and [Compliance Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_pipelines.html). This gives users two very different ways of implementing the same functionality, which has been described as confusing for users. Compliance pipelines also have some inherent technical limitation, see [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6241).

### Visibility

Currently the Standards are hard coded in the Adherence report (renamed to Status report) and separate from Compliance Frameworks. This makes the system inflexible as we look to:

1. Use Compliance Frameworks to include certain projects in the Adherence Report and distinguish which requirements those projects are complaint with.
1. Add a Requirements level to the Adherence report
1. Add more Standards and Checks
1. Allow users to customise Standards
1. Allow users to create their own Standards
1. Allow users to create customisable Checks

### History

This is currently achieved through compliance events ([Audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/audit_events.html) and [Violations within MRs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_center/compliance_violations_report.html)). Both of these are outside the scope of this blueprint

### Goals

1. Provide support need for multiple frameworks
1. Incongruence with compliance pipelines and security policies
1. Use Compliance Frameworks to include certain projects in the Adherence Report and distinguish which requirements those projects are complaint with.
1. Add a Requirements level to the Adherence report
1. Add more Standards and Checks
1. Allow users to customise Standards
1. Allow users to create their own Standards

### Non-Goals

1. Allow users to create customisable Checks
1. Compliance events
   1. [Violations within MRs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_center/compliance_violations_report.html)
   1. [Audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/audit_events.html)

## Terminology/Glossary

1. Framework
   1. A [Compliance Framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_frameworks.html) is a user-modifiable capability within GitLab to identify projects that have certain compliance requirements or need additional oversight. Compliance Frameworks generally align with established industry compliance frameworks such as SOC2 or ISO 27001.
1. Standard - deprecated in favor of framework
   1. A standard groups together compliance checks in the Adherence report. Compliance standards align with established compliance frameworks/standards such as SOC2 or ISO 27001
1. Adherence
   1. Reports the percentage of a projects compliance posture against a compliance framework. For example if Project A is 50% complaint towards Framework A.
1. [Policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/)
1. Requirement
   1. A particular requirement from an industry standard compliance frameworks/standards such as SOC2 or ISO 27001. Usually a statement of intent for a particular part of the compliance framework.
1. Check
   1. A Check is a review of a project's settings, to confirm that it is in a particular position. Checks compose a percentage of a project's compliance posture against a Requirement.
1. Control
   1. A control is a compliance enforcement mechanism which enforces certain requirements. This is achieved in GitLab through settings, Security Policies or Compliance Pipelines.
