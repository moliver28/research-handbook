<!--
Before you start:

- Copy this file to a sub-directory and call it `_index.md` for it to appear in
  the design documents list.
- Remove comment blocks for sections you've filled in.
  When your document ready for review, all of these comment blocks should be
  removed.

To get started with a document you can use this template to inform you about
what you may want to document in it at the beginning. This content will change
/ evolve as you move forward with the proposal.  You are not constrained by the
content in this template. If you have a good idea about what should be in your
document, you can ignore the template, but if you don't know yet what should
be in it, this template might be handy.

- **Fill out this file as best you can.** At minimum, you should fill in the
  "Summary", and "Motivation" sections.  These can be brief and may be a copy
  of issue or epic descriptions if the initiative is already on Product's
  roadmap.
- **Create a MR for this document.** Assign it to an Architecture Evolution
  Coach (i.e. a Principal+ engineer).
- **Merge early and iterate.** Avoid getting hung up on specific details and
  instead aim to get the goals of the document clarified and merged quickly.
  The best way to do this is to just start with the high-level sections and fill
  out details incrementally in subsequent MRs.

Just because a document is merged does not mean it is complete or approved.
Any document is a working document and subject to change at any time.

When editing documents, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic MRs to keep
discussions focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a
new MR with suggested changes.

If there are new details that belong in the document, edit the document. Once
a feature has become "implemented", major changes should get new blueprints.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/content/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/_template.md).

Document statuses you can use:

- "proposed"
- "accepted"
- "ongoing"
- "implemented"
- "postponed"
- "rejected"

## Summary

The Package Metadata Database (PMDB) (formally [external license DB](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8492)) houses both license 
and advisory data in an external postgresql database hosted in GCP. GitLab is investigating
adding additional package metadata to this database which makes it infeasible to copy or
export all data directly to customers instances.

Current operation of this database assumes data is to be first collected in this GCP
database, and then data is to be pulled down by individual GitLab instances, whether
it's GitLab.com or customer managed on-premise systems.

This proposal proposes different methods of storage or architectures to allow additional
package metadata that may or may not be pulled directly to customers instances.

## Motivation

The PMDB is a datastore that could benefit by being extended to house additional
package metadata. This could include other data such as project health (OpenSSF scores), 
additional links to dependent packages, author information, and any other metadata that 
could be useful by GitLab or our customers to make security critical decisions about their 
dependencies.

Customers may want to opt into collecting some of this data locally in their instances, where
additional data could be accessible remotely via an API.

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this document. Describe why the change is important, all the opportunities,
and the benefits to users.

The motivation section can optionally provide links to issues that demonstrate
interest in a document within the wider GitLab community. Links to
documentation for competing products and services is also encouraged in cases
where they demonstrate clear gaps in the functionality GitLab provides.

For concrete proposals we recommend laying out goals and non-goals explicitly,
but this section may be framed in terms of problem statements, challenges, or
opportunities. The latter may be a more suitable framework in cases where the
problem is not well-defined or design details not yet established.
-->

### Goals

- Determine additional architectures that would allow GitLab to collect additional metadata for projects and versions
- Determine methodologies for allowing customers to select which data they want to pull
- Determine what types of additional data GitLab wishes to house
- Make architectural decisions which will easily allow additional data sources in the future to be added
- Agree and design an architecture which can allow for the above points in a performant manner


### Non-Goals

- TBD

## Proposal

- High Level:
- Design an external API for additional Metadata
- Design better compression methods where all data could be easily stored on each GitLab instance
- Design easy method to add additional data types/metadata to be collected
- 
<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is,
but keep it simple!  This should have enough detail that reviewers can
understand exactly what you're proposing, but should not include things like
API designs or implementation. The "Design Details" section below is for the
real nitty-gritty.

You might want to consider including the pros and cons of the proposed solution so that they can be
compared with the pros and cons of alternatives.
-->

## Design and implementation details

- TBD
<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

If you are not sure how many implementation details you should include in the
document, the rule of thumb here is to provide enough context for people to
understand the proposal. As you move forward with the implementation, you may
need to add more implementation details to the document, as those may become
an important context for important technical decisions made along the way. A
document is also a register of such technical decisions. If a technical
decision requires additional context before it can be made, you probably should
document this context in a document. If it is a small technical decision that
can be made in a merge request by an author and a maintainer, you probably do
not need to document it here. The impact a technical decision will have is
another helpful information - if a technical decision is very impactful,
documenting it, along with associated implementation details, is advisable.

If it's helpful to include workflow diagrams or any other related images.
Diagrams authored in GitLab flavored markdown are preferred. In cases where
that is not feasible, images should be placed under `images/` in the same
directory as the `index.md` for the proposal.
-->

## Alternative Solutions

- TBD
<!--
It might be a good idea to include a list of alternative solutions or paths considered, although it is not required. Include pros and cons for
each alternative solution/path.

"Do nothing" and its pros and cons could be included in the list too.
