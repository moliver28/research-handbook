## Principal 

Principal-level engineers in infrastructure are significantly driving the department's results and culture by supporting teams at the same time as helping set and align on future group direction.  Principal engineers are expected to balance the day-to-day details needed to guide and unblock individual teams with a longer term view needed to set the group up for future success. Principal engineers are primarily focused on a group but work across the entire company to maintain relationships and share information.
