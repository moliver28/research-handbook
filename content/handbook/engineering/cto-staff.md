## Engineering All-Hands

The Engineering All-Hands meeting happens monthly on alternating time slots in place of a [CTO Office Hours](../#communication).

The purpose is to share company updates, stay connected, and receive feedback.

The entire Engineering group is invited, though anyone at GitLab is welcome to attend and contribute to [the All-Hands agenda](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=engineering%20all%20hands%20agenda) (internal). As with all general meetings at GitLab, attendance is optional though encouraged, and will be recorded.

## Engineering Offsite

The quarterly Engineering offsite provides a forum for longer-form discussion among the CTO's direct reports. The goals from the first offsite were:

1. Strategy
1. Cross-functional alignment
1. Break in weekly routine
1. Get better at offsites

### Schedule

The Enginering offsite happens after the quarter's corresponding [E-group offsite](/handbook/company/offsite/).

It runs Tuesday to Thursday inclusive in EMEA and AMER, which is Wednesday to Friday inclusive in APAC. It does not start on the Monday because that is reserved for the [All-directs zoom call](/handbook/company/offsite/#all-directs-zoom-call) following the E-group offsite. The dates below are the dates in AMER timezones for previous and upcoming offsites.

#### Timezones

We try to set the meeting times with the maximum overlap between the timezones of all the attendees. However, because we need to accommodate people in widely differing timezones, sometimes that isn't possible.

In that case, we put items in the best fit for a given person's timezone when they're most relevant. For instance, if a People Business Partner is in EMEA, the People items will happen at the start of the day's sessions.

### Agenda

The specific agenda for each offsite depends on active projects. Typical items include:

1. People
    1. Succession planning (**in Q2 and Q4**)
       1. Did anything change in the succession plan compared to six months ago?
       1. Did anything change in the [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) for all VP's directs?
    1. Director+ promotion planning
    1. Hiring plan
    1. Relevant People projects around performance, engagement, and retention
1. [Big rocks](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-5-choices/choice-3/) (large initiatives) presentation and discussion
1. Direction updates (**annual in Q4**)
    1. [Support](/handbook/support/#fy23-direction) has been using epics to track their direction progress throughout the year. This is recommended but not required.
1. OKR planning for the next quarter
1. Department-to-department feedback (always last)

In general, we prefer to have more items than we can fit into the agenda, and then push some items out, rather than have too little.
