title: "Incident Reviews"

## Introduction

An Incident Review is a **crucial opportunity for fostering deeper understanding** within a blameless culture. Its purpose extends beyond collecting action items to prevent recrurance; it is a process for learning about both the **systems** and the **engineering culture** that contribute to incidents. By discussing and analyzing how these components operate and interact, we gain vailuable insights into the technical environments we support and the broader organizational context in which they function. 

At GitLab we are commited to the practice of blameless incident reviews. This means we intentionally focus on understanding the "why" and "how" of incidents, rather than assigning blame or seeking to identify individuals at fault. Incident Reviews may contain references to individuals or team names to help provide a first hand account and valuable context, but these references are never intended to cast blame. Instead, they serve as a means to better understand the seqeuence of events, the decision-making processes involved, and the challanges faced during the incident.

We adhear to this blameless model to encourage open communication, trust, and close collaobration. It allows everyone to share their perspectives and obervations without fear of retribution. 

While continuous learning is the primary and paramount focus of these blameless reviews, they also serve a practical purpose. They lead to the identification and implementation of actionable improvements that enhance the resilience and reliability of our systems, ultimately strengthening our engineering culture and improving our ability to serve our users.
