title: "Cells"

description: "This is the handbook page for the Cells project. Cells is one of the top priorities for FY2025, with the goal of providing additional scalability for GitLab.com. This handbook page contains the project information such as the project plan, roadmap, workstreams, DRIs, stakeholders, and communication channels. It also has links to important documentation such as the Cells design blueprints."

## Intro

Cells is a new architecture for our software as a service platform. This architecture is horizontally scalable, resilient, and provides a more consistent user experience. It may also provide additional features in the future, such as data residency control (regions) and federated features.

For more information about the goals of Cells, see [goals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/cells/goals.html).

## Program Planning and Tracking

All Cells 1.0 work is tracked under the [Cells 1.0 Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12383). We also have a planning [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1h99JKDuNJbfv46rFniCGg0Z0Mgm1QA8OyuSGxosFo/edit#gid=0) that provides a high level program structure and timelines (for planning purpose only).

### Cells 1.0 Milestones

1. First Production Cell - Experimental
   - label: [cells-1.0-milestone::Experiment](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3Aexperiment&first_page_size=20)
   - Production system with no production customer data. We have an environment that covers testing needs of Test Platform and Development teams.
   - Entering criteria: A cell is brought up so that development teams and Infra teams have an environment to test their changes, Test platform team has a place to run different kind of tests, including E2E, automation test and etc.
   - Exit criteria: All the [planned Cells 1.0 application features](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/cells/iterations/cells-1.0.html#features-on-gitlabcom-that-are-not-supported-on-cells) are supported, a Cell is provisioned using the cells lifecycle automation tools, and we run our existing E2E tests on Cells as part of our deployment pipeline
1. First Production Cell - Production Ready
   - label: [cells-1.0-milestone::GA](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3Aga&first_page_size=20)
   - We have a production instance that is ready for internal or external customer's production use
   - Entering Criteria: Exit criteria of Experiment

### Cells 1.0 Timeline

- 2024-11-30: Experimental
- 2025-01-31: Production Ready

#### Cells 1.0 Development Phases

The listed phases will be applied for both Staging then at a later stage to Production, if not stated otherwise. We use the `cells-1.0-milestone::Phase x` labels to categorize issues by phase.

1. [Phase 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%201): Deploy router as a pass-through proxy for GitLab.com
1. [Phase 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%202): Deploy router as a pass-through proxy for registry.GitLab.com
   - Registry behind the WAF
   - Pass through proxy to Cell 1
1. [Phase 3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%203): Routing via classification
   - Topology Service deployed with classification with Runway
   - mTLS between the router and topology service
   - Works with GDK and Cell 2 (QA) to unblock development/testing of certain workflows.
1. [Phase 4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%204): Complete Cells Services

1. [Phase 5](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%205): Register existing GitLab.com as a Cell with Topology Service
   1. Phase 5a: Legacy infrastructure becomes a cell
   1. Phase 5b: Database Sequencing Service - Sequence claiming is enabled on Cell 1 (legacy GitLab.com)
1. [Phase 6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%206): Cell 2 Ready (QA cell, no external customers)
   1. Phase 6a: Application Readiness
      - Basic functionality across Cells such as sign-up, project creation, running pipelines.
      - Enable organizations FF on Cell 2
      - Hook up Fulfillment/License
   1. Phase 6b: Continuous Deployment to Cell 2 (QA cell, no external customers)
      - Dedicated on GCP pre-GA

   - Internal customers only
1. [Phase 10](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3APhase%210): Create an organization for a GitLab internal customer, for example Finance
   - Enable organization FF on Cell 3
   - Move the internal customer to Cell 3 with Direct Transfer

### Work Estimation

We use t-shirt sizing to estimate the time and effort needed to deliver issues/epics. Sizes are not meant to be viewed as precise estimations or timeline commitments. Rather, these sizes help us identify risk areas and opportunities for cutting scope. Sizes map to the following definitions:

| Size   | Time       |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Tiny   | 1-2 weeks  |
| Small  | 1 month    |
| Medium | 3 months   |
| Large  | 6 months   |
| XXL    | > 6 months |
