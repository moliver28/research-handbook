# Summary

This handbook page outlines the Upgrade Improvements project, one of the top CTO priorities. The project aims to enhance customer's experience of the entire lifecycle of upgrading a GitLab instance.

This page contains the project information such as the project plan, roadmap, workstreams, DRIs, stakeholders, and communication channels.

# Project Plan

Upgrading GitLab can be challenging, varying in difficulty from upgrade to upgrade and deployment. Hence, this is a multiphase project giving the wide scope and number of stakeholders involved.

Refer to [Upgrade Improvements project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbZP2bCi25efAxUZQX21NIu_gcMv7jHoR8gEny9BSVI/edit) (Internal only) and the project [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10949 "GitLab upgrade improvements") for more details.
