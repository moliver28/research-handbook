## Why do we have OKRs?

GitLab employees and managers need to make conscious, careful, and informed choices about how we allocate our teams' time and energy. OKRs are the manifestation of those careful choices, and the means by which we coordinate the actions of individuals to achieve great collective goals.

- OKR helps us to articulate the goals so everyone (not just our team) can understand what we want to achieve
- OKR helps us track and measure progress
- OKR helps us reassess and stretch

## Definitions

- Objectives are what you want to accomplish
- Key results are how you will accomplish the objectives

## Writing Effective OKRs

### Objectives

1. Objectives express goals and intents, in a clear and concise way
   - Tip: If your objective doesn’t fit on one line, it probably isn’t crisp enough
1. Objectives must be tangible, objective, and unambiguous; it should be obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has been achieved
   - Tip: Write them as an after-the-fact statement, as if it's the end of the intended period
   - Good Example: GitLab engineering teams are Elite in all DORA categories
1. The successful achievement of an objective must provide clear value for GitLab and/or our users & customers

### Key results

1. Key Results express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their constituents
   - Tip: A common error is writing KRs which are necessary but not sufficient to collectively complete the O. (For objective that spans multiple quarters or years, all the KRs within the same time period should be sufficiently to collectively complete the O)
   - Tip: Try to game your KRs: if you can find a way to score 100% on each KR yet largely miss the objective, then you don’t have good KRs
1. Key Results should describe outcomes, not activities
   - Tip: If your KRs include words like "consult", "help", "analyze", "participate", they're describing activities.  Instead, describe the end-user impact of these activities
   - Good Example: Product X successfully launched with 50M 30-day active users
   - Less Good Example: Launch Product X
   - Bad Example: Work on Product X launch
1. Measurable milestones should include evidence of completion; this evidence should be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of evidence include MR, links to docs, notes, published metrics reports, etc.

## OKR Priority

Each OKR should have an explicit priority assigned to it when writing a proposal. The priority should be reviewed and could be adjusted during planning

1. P0 - Committed
   - OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we will be willing to adjust schedule and resources to ensure that they are delivered
   - P0s should always be staffed ahead of other OKRs, and when they are at risk we should be able to de-staff non-P0 efforts to pull them back on track
   - An OKR score of 1.0 is expected at the end of the quarter and a score of 0.99 would still be considered a miss. If the score is lower than 1.0, Team needs to understand why it happened and what can be learn from it

1. P1 - Important
   - These are the important things that the team is definitely going to work on
   - It's expected to make significant progress on this during the quarter but we’re not necessarily promising it *all* gets done
   - An OKR score of 0.7 or above should be expected at the end of the quarter. If the score is below 0.5, we need to understand why it happened and what can be learned from it for the future planning

1. P2 - Aspirational
   - These are things the team is going to work on, but with expectation that higher priority items might take precedent
   - These KRs are expected to be completed within this quarter or next
   - If P0/P1 are at risk - it's expected that P2 can be deferred and the team should shift attention to make sure that higher priority KRs are delivered

Note:  An OKR should NOT depend on another OKR with lower priority. (e.g. A P0 OKR cannot depend on a P1 or P2 OKR)

## Joint OKRs

Many important projects require contribution from a number of different groups/teams. Joint OKRs are ideally suited to commit to this coordination. Joint OKRs should include all the teams which must materially participate in the OKR, and OKRs committing to each team's contribution should appear explicitly in each such team's OKRs. Thus for example if Testing Platform and Engineering Produtivity teams must deliver to support a new service, then both teams should have OKRs describing their commitment to deliver their part of the project

## OKR Input

The following sources can be considered as input data to OKR planning:

- Carry-over OKRs from the previous quarter
- Top-down organisational OKRs and mandates (Company OKR, Department OKR and etc)
- Customer requests
- Bottom-up ideas from team members
- Requests from other Groups/Teams
- OKR candidate bugs from backlog
- Management guidelines and priorities
