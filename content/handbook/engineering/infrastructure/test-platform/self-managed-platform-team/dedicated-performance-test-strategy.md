title: Performance Testing in Dedicated
---

## Overview

Doing performance testing is a complicated process to do well. This page is targeted at clarifying our process for doing performance testing as it relates to Dedicated and subsequently Cells and FedRAMP.

## Approach

Our base performance test approach is proactively test against [Reference Architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures). We do this by running [GPT against the latest Nightly release of GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/performance-and-scalability/#test-process).
