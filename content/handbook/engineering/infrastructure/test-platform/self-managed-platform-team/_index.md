## Test Platform process across product sections:

Overall we follow the same process as [defined](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/#how-we-work) in our Quality Engineering handbook across all groups in Enablement
except for a few exceptions curated to fit the needs of specific groups.
