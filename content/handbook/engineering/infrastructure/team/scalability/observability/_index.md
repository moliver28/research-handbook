This is subject of expansion as we work out direction and vision for the team.

## Team Members

The following people are members of the Scalability:Observability team:

{{< team-by-manager-slug "liam-m" >}}

The team is located all over the world in [different timezones](https://timezonewizard.com/p4-6e9).

## How we work

### Group call

We hold a weekly, 30 minutes group call at alternating times to facilitate a synchronous conversation across members of the group.
While attendance is optional, joining the call if you can and otherwise catching up on the recording is encouraged.

The purpose of the call is to have a space and time for the group to
* discuss team-level concerns,
* facilitate organisation of work across team members,
* chat about any impediments to resolve those quicker,
* and generally have a space and time to hang out as a team and socialize.

While we emphasize on collaborating async, we embrace the opportunity for synchronous conversation.

However, the call is **not meant to be used**
* to provide regular status updates (as those are expected to be given async),
* make decisions without async collaboration.

The non-social part of the group call will be recorded and uploaded to Google Drive automatically.

The agenda of the call can be found in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i59l3MwUcLo74CzZGxwF29DHzkhk8mpHgrz26zyb4WY) (internal link).
As usual, the agenda can be used to collaborate async and in advance to any calls happening.

The timing of the call follows the time of the Scalability demo call, which happens at three different times across three weeks.
The group call is scheduled to start 30 minutes before the demo call.

### Updates in Slack

In order to stay informed with everyone's immediate topics, we post regular status updates in our Slack channel.

These updates include whatever the team member is currently working on and dealing with, for example consider including current focus area, general work items, blockers, in-flight changes, learnings, side tracks, upcoming time off and other relevant information.

There is no strict frequency for posting updates, although we strive to make updates at least once per week.

When posting updates, consider providing enough context (e.g. through links) so that interested team members are able to dive in on their own ([low context](/handbook/communication/#top-tips-and-best-practices)).
