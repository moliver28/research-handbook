## Introduction

SRE oncall onboarding buddies play a crucial role in ensuring a positive and effective onboarding experience for new engineers joining the oncall rotation. Being on call can be very stressful, particularly for engineers who are new to the role or unfamiliar with our systems and processes. 
That's why it's essential that all new engineers joining the oncall rotation be assigned a buddy who is ready and willing to assist with the onboarding process. These buddies are experienced oncall engineers who can provide guidance, support, and share their invaluable knowledge.

The SRE oncall buddy system is designed to:

- Accelerate the oncall onboarding process for new engineers
- Reduce stress and anxiety associated with oncall responsibilities
- Help new engineers gain confidence in their ability to handle incidents
- Ensure that new team members become self-sufficient oncall engineers more quickly
- Promote knowledge sharing and best practices within the team

By pairing new engineers with experienced buddies, we create a supportive environment that allows for faster learning, better incident response, and a more resilient team overall. This system not only benefits the new engineers but also strengthens our entire oncall process by continuously refining and sharing our collective expertise.
