title: Growth Stage
description: "The Growth Stage consists of development teams working in the product delivering enhancements and running experiments"

## Vision

Grow an agile fullstack development capability to support our product goals through feature development and experiments
enabling GitLab to make informed product decisions and achieve results in line with our [product direction](/handbook/marketing/growth/).

## Mission

Working inline with our [values](/handbook/values/), we focus on [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) and [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration),
working with and across areas of the product our development department counterparts maintain,
as well our own [areas of responsibility](/handbook/marketing/growth/#product-ownership).

## Direction

We work on the issues prioritized by our product teams including running [experiments](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/) on GitLab.com.
More information on priorities can be found on the [Growth direction](/handbook/marketing/growth/) page.

Growth stage teams have Fullstack Engineers.
The reason for this is that the Growth stage has a need for both Frontend and Backend skill-sets,
but as a small team, has optimized for team member efficiency to adopt the Fullstack role.

Some useful links to see how and what we are working on include:

- [Growth direction](/handbook/marketing/growth/)
- [Growth Kanban board for development](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1392106?&label_name%5B%5D=devops%3A%3Agrowth)
- [Experimentation](experimentation/)
- [GLEX](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-experiment)
- [Experiment rollout](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1352542?label_name[]=experiment-rollout)
- [acquisition](acquisition/) group
- [activation](activation/) group

Growth teams contribute to a GitLab [experimentation](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/) gem to make it easier to run experiments and make data driven product decisions on GitLab.com.

## How We Work

Our team follows the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#workflow-summary) utilizing all labels from `~workflow::start` to `~workflow::complete`.

We adhere to the **Completion Criteria** and **Who Transitions Out** outlined in the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#workflow-summary) to progress issues from one stage to the next.

### Labels and Workflow Boards

We use workflow boards to track issue progress throughout a milestone. Workflow boards should be viewed at the highest group level for visibility into all nested projects in a group.

The Growth stage uses the `~"devops::growth"` label and the following groups for tracking merge request rate and ownership of issues and merge requests.

| Name          | Label                   | gitlab-org | All Groups |
| ----------    | -----------             | ------     | ------     |
| Growth        | `~"devops::growth"`     | [Growth Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4152639) | [-](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth) |
| Acquisition   | `~"group::acquisition"` | [Acquisition Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4152639) | [-](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aacquisition) |
| Activation    | `~"group::activation"`  | [Activation Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4152639) | [-](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aactivation) |
| Experiments   | `~"experiment-rollout"` | [Experiment tracking](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1352542) | [-](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=experiment-rollout) |
| Feature Flags | `~"feature flag"`       | [Feature flags](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1725470?&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=feature%20flag) |  |

Growth teams work across the GitLab codebase on multiple groups and projects including:

- The [gitlab.com/gitlab-org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/) group
- [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
- [GLEX](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-experiment)
- [customers-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com)
- The [gitlab.com/gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/) group
- [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com)

### Issue sequencing

In order to convey Issue implementation order and blocking concepts,
we leverage the [blocking issue linking feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html#blocking-issues).

More on the discussion can be seen in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/-/issues/752.

### Issue Refinement And Estimation

Before the work can begin on an issue, we should refine and estimate it. We have a continuous process for this, leveraging additional workflow status,  `~"workflow::refinement"`, which indicates that the issue is being refined by the team. Once the issue refinement is completed, it can be moved to `~"workflow::scheduling"` stage.

The refinement process is driven by [triage bot automations and policies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blob/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/growth/refine-automations.yml) to ensure that it's smooth and consistent.

## Refinement Steps

1. Issues are moved from `~"workflow::planning breakdown"` to `~"workflow::refinement"` automatically by the triage bot in order of priority (from top to bottom). The bot will only move issues to refinement if there is room in refinement column, meaning there is less issues than maximum limit for this column. This is first chance for PMs to prioritize issues by moving them higher in the `planning breakdown` column. After the issue is moved to refinement, a dedicated `refinement thread` is created, which acts as a place for discussion and weight estimation.
     - üí° Hint: In rare case when an issue has to be expedited, it's possible to move it to refinement manually. This will invoke a reaction from triage bot, which will add `refinement thread` for such issue instantly so the refinement can proceed the same way as with automated path.
2. During refinement the team ensures that the issue is well described and requirements are clear. They can use the `refinement thread` to discuss but they should make sure that any changes and decisions made there are also reflected in issue's description. Once each engineer is comfortable with the way the issue is described, they can vote their estimation of weight based on our [guidelines](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/index.html#estimation-guidelines). The voting happens by reacting to the thread with one of few possible weight estimates: 1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ 5Ô∏è‚É£ or üöÄ.
3. Each day the triage bot checks all issues in `~"workflow::refinement"` column and if an issue has required minimum number of estimation votes (see `MIN_REACTIONS` constant [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blob/master/lib/growth_refine_automation_helper.rb?ref_type=heads#L16) for the current setting) it will be moved to `~"workflow::scheduling"`.
    - üí° Hint: If there is some problem with the issue and it shouldn't be moved forward even if enough engineers estimate it, ‚ùå reaction can be added to the thread which will stop the bot from transitioning the issue to `~"workflow::scheduling"` as long as this reaction sticks to the thread. This means that whoever put it is also responsible for removing it once the problem is gone.
4. Once the issue is in `~"workflow::scheduling"`, it is awaiting final prioritization by PMs - it has to be manually moved to `~"workflow::ready for dev"` depending on the current priorities. This part of the process is PMs responsibility. This allows for additional fine-tuning of priorities and acts as a buffer for our ready for development column.

## Estimation guidelines

| Weight | Description (Engineering) |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | The simplest possible change. We are confident there will be no side effects. |
| 2 | A simple change (minimal code changes), where we understand all of the requirements. |
| 3 | A simple change, but the code footprint is bigger (e.g. lots of different files, or tests effected). The requirements are clear. |
| 5 | A more complex change that will impact multiple areas of the codebase, there may also be some refactoring involved. Requirements are understood but you feel there are likely to be some gaps along the way. |
| 8 | A complex change, that will involve much of the codebase or will require lots of input from others to determine the requirements. |
| 13| A significant change that may have dependencies (other teams or third-parties) and we likely still don't understand all of the requirements. It's unlikely we would commit to this in a milestone, and the preference would be to further clarify requirements and/or break in to smaller Issues. |

In planning and estimation, we value [velocity over predictability](/handbook/engineering/development/principles/#velocity-over-predictability). The main goal of our planning and estimation is to focus on the [MVC](/handbook/values/#minimal-valuable-change-mvc), uncover blind spots, and help us achieve a baseline level of predictability without over optimizing. We aim for 70% predictability instead of 90%. We believe that optimizing for velocity (merge request rate) enables our Growth teams to achieve a [weekly experimentation cadence](/handbook/product/groups/growth/#weekly-growth-meeting).

- If an issue has many unknowns where it's unclear if it's a 1 or a 5, we will be cautious and estimate high (5).
- If an issue has many unknowns, we can break it into two issues. The first issue is for research, also referred to as a [Spike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)), where we de-risk the unknowns and explore potential solutions. The second issue is for the implementation.
- If an initial estimate is incorrect and needs to be adjusted, we revise the estimate immediately and inform the Product Manager. The Product Manager and team will decide if a milestone commitment needs to be adjusted.

## Engineering DRI
The Engineering DRI role is crucial for managing larger chunks of work within our team. This role is assigned to epics that have reached the development stage or to issues that are too large and have been promoted to epics. The DRI is assigned before the work is broken down into smaller deliverables, as one of their key responsibilities is to facilitate the planning and breakdown process.

### Role Responsibilities
*Communicating Progress and Managing Health Status*
The DRI is responsible for providing weekly updates on the epic, including tracking the overall health status of the work, such as progress, obstacles, and emerging risks.
* The DRI should continuously monitor and report on the health status of the epic, indicating if it is on track, at risk, or blocked, and provide context around any changes.
* Progress updates should be reported via a top-level comment on the epic that contains the development work (usually linked to our OKRs).
* Updates are due by End of Day on each Friday.

*Facilitating Breakdown of Work*
The DRI plays a crucial role in breaking down epics into smaller, manageable deliverables, ensuring that tasks are clearly defined and ready for development.

*Ensuring Steady Progress*
The DRI ensures that work items are progressing smoothly through our Kanban flow, with enough work prepared for development to maintain consistent progress.

*Risk Management and Mitigation*
The DRI is responsible for identifying potential risks early in the process and proactively working with the team to develop mitigation strategies. This responsibility enhances the DRI‚Äôs role in not only communicating issues but actively managing and resolving them.

*Retrospective and Continuous Improvement*
At the conclusion of each epic, the DRI should facilitate a brief retrospective session to gather feedback on what went well and areas for improvement. This practice helps refine processes and improve the handling of future epics.

*Collaboration with Product and Design*
The DRI should actively collaborate with Product Managers and Designers during the planning phase to ensure that the scope of the epic aligns with business goals and user experience standards.

*Resource Allocation and Escalation*
The DRI is empowered to identify when additional resources or support are needed and to escalate issues promptly. This helps ensure that timelines are met and work progresses smoothly.

*Note:* The DRI is responsible for timely delivery, not execution of every task.

## Technical exploration ("Spike") guidelines

Occasionally, the team will be asked to dedicate time to exploring or "spiking" a technical solution to a problem or opporunity area deemed a priority by Growth PM. Technical spikes are fundamentally different than our typical work items as the result is more commonly a recommendation on a technical direction or solution (in the form of additional epics and/or issues) rather than code, yet they still require dedicated developer focus and should be accounted for in our development workflows. As such, we've determined the following guidelines and responsibilities for individual Growth Engineers to follow when addressing a techincal spike in our workflow:

Note: As of Q2 FY25, technical spikes will follow the same workflow process as code-based issues - they will enter `~workflow::refinement`, then be scheduled and prioritized for pick up in `~workflow::ready for development`. Active technical spike work will be represented in `~workflow::in dev`. Once outputs are completed, the technical spike issue will be closed and moved to `~workflow::complete`.

**Inputs**

As a technical spike is prioritized and available for pickup in `~workflow::ready for development`, complete the following steps:

- Assign yourself to the technical spike along with the current milestone
- If not already added, add the ~spike label to the issue.
- Connect with the responsible PM to align on a reasonable due date for the technical spike. Duration will be dependent on the subject matter and Growth's familiarity with the topic.
- Once determined, assign a due date.
- Review the contents of the technical spike issue body. Add a comment to clarify outstanding questions with the responsible PM. This is a great time to highlight potential needs for cross-collaboration with other teams or code or Product subject matter experts, or other inputs you feel will be important to the technical spike.
- If possible, add a comment with a proposed plan for how you intend to address the spike and whether any PM checkpoints, etc. would be desired.
**During the technical spike investigation period**

- Communicate any relevant learnings or discoveries that could impact duration or scope needed for the spike with the responsible PM
- If you are nearing the assigned due date and will be in need of more time for the investigation, reach out to the responsible PM to align on next steps

**Outputs**

As the technical spike work comes to a completion, complete the following steps to close out the spike process:

- Provide a summary comment with detailed learnings of your investigation and recommended path(s) for the solution in the spike issue. Include an outline of the recommended next step issues and/or epics to be created for the next phase of work.
- Tag in the responsible PM, EM, and Growth Engineering team (`@gitlab-org/growth/engineering` team) for review.
- Confirm with the responsible PM that the spike requirements have been met within the alotted duration time.
- Move the technical spike issue to `~workflow::complete`.
- Close the technical spike issue.

### UX

Info on the Growth UX team and how they work can be found on the [Product/Growth page](/handbook/product/groups/growth/#ux).

### How We Use Issues

To help our team be [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency), we explicitly define how our team uses issues.

#### Issue Creation

We aim to create issues in the same project as where the future merge request will live. For example, if an experiment is being run in the [GitLab CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com), both the issue and MR should be created in the [CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com) project.

We emphasize creating the issue in the right project to avoid having to close and move issues later in the development process. If the location of the future merge request cannot be determined, we will create the issue in our catch-all [growth team-tasks project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/issues).

We use [issue templates](experimentation/#experiment-issue-templates) for common tasks.

#### Iteration

To support [Iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) Growth engineering:

1. Separates refactoring from feature [MVCs](/handbook/values/#minimal-valuable-change-mvc). When refactoring is raised in review, the preference is to resolve in a follow up issue.
1. Addresses technical debt and follow up issues through prioritization and discussion by relevant stakeholders.
1. Issues with a weight of `5` and higher should be reassigned to the Product Manager to make sure they can be split into smaller [MVCs](/handbook/values/#minimal-valuable-change-mvc).
   When this is not possible, the Product Manager will create a spike or research issue so that engineering can break it down and close the original.
1. We make use of research issues and engineering spikes in the prior milestone, so estimations are more accurate.

#### Status Updates

The DRI (assignee) of an issue is encouraged to add an async issue update, particularly for issues labeled `~Deliverable` or `~Stretch`.
These updates can be added anytime and are useful to highlight when an issue is on track, blocked, or may need to be re-prioritized.
This helps us maintain [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) and our [bias towards asynchronous communication](/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication).

```markdown
Async issue update

**YYYY-MM-DD Update**

#### Please provide a quick summary of the current status (one sentence)

#### When do you predict this feature to be ready for maintainer review?

#### Are there any opportunities to further break the issue or merge request into smaller pieces (if applicable)?

#### Were expectations met from a previous update? If not, please explain why

```

### Experimentation

The Growth groups regularly run experiments to test product hypothesis.

- Read about the [experimentation process](experimentation/).
- View the [developer documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/experiment_guide/)
- View slides for the [Experimentation Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nmStWChWkYad9K-dced9wS4jS7XLIrHB-WKafc7jrMU/)

GitLab team members are welcome to attend the Growth Stage Engineering Weekly meetings
to connect with growth team members and find out more about running experiments at GitLab.

### Growth Metrics

The Growth stage tracks number of experiments deployed as a development metric. This is not an individual or team performance indicator. This allows teams to track their technical debt.

New experiments added to the codebase using [experiment feature flags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#experiment-type) are tracked until removal.
Current experiments shows the total number of experiments in the codebase (pending, active, or concluded and ready to be removed).
