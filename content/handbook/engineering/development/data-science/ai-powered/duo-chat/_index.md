## 📚 Internal Processes

### UX Reviews

- Since Duo Chat doesn't have a dedicated UX person, the UX experts from the AI Framework team will assist with our UX reviews.
- It’s encouraged to include a clear screencast with each MR. Reviewers should try to reproduce changes locally or, if that’s not feasible, schedule a sync-up to collaborate effectively.
- UX reviews will be aimed for every user-facing MR, as long as capacities allow. Availability will be communicated on the MR itself if there are any changes.
