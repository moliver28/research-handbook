title: AI-Powered Stage
description: "The AI-Powered Stage in the Data Science section is focused on providing applied AI capabilties to the GitLab product."
---

## Vision

Build diverse and global development teams in the Data Science section to support GitLab's vision on the application of AI in the DevOps cycle,
while maintaining [our values](/handbook/values/) and [unique way of working](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/guide/).

## Mission

Drive results through iterative development as we add AI features with flexible ML Models capabilities into the product.
Our teams are data-driven, support [dogfooding](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/dogfooding/), and [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) within GitLab and the wider community.

### AI Powered Operational Agreements

- **Sustainable way of working**: Getting all of our teams back to a sustainable way of working as a first priority. The ambiguity in work schedules, uncertainty around who has license to make decisions, and changes in priority lead to a lack of predictability for people's work, which creates stress and a reduced sense of psychological safety.
- **Collaboration**: Addressing collaboration problems thoroughly and in real time as they arise so we can reduce the their negative impact on business outcomes and encourage more psychological safety.
- **Roadmap review and revision**: Reducing the frequency of changes to near-term roadmap. Review our major roadmap items monthly, driven by a focus on accounting for market externalities, customer feedback, and rollout/scale pains.  We will approach major product milestone completions in a measured fashion so we can help teams be more efficient, plan implementations, and set expectations without being given a delivery timeline.
- **Communication cascade**: We want to capture details in issues to avoid reliance, build trust, provide additional context, align everyone on priorities, and prevent communication surprises.
  - Always assign a DRI to create an issue (Ideally, whoever is communicating is the person creating the issue)
  - Make sure the DRI is included especially when things change quickly!
  - Leadership should set explicit expectations. There should be space and time for questions and discussions. Ask for this if you are not getting it, because we will then be responsible for communication moving forward.
  - There are regular [AI Exec meetings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ai-powered/ai-weekly/-/issues) where non-MNPI read outs will be shared.
  - For senior leaders, EMs and PMs across the primary AI teams to make sure they have a place to align with each other, we use `#ai-leads`.
  - To include the quads, engineers, designers, testers, infra, our key Marketing stakeholders, etc that are working on AI, we use `#ai-portfolio`. This will help us provide a SSoT avenue for communication so we donâ€™t confuse groups or disseminate information separately.
  - In this way, we will avoid multiple downward communications or conflicting messages,  keep discussions inside issues, and be able to retain autonomy on the roadmap according to Roadmap Review & Revision. 
- **Blocking work**: Address blocked work or critical responses being needed within a reasonable time to empower team members to drive progress and move forward.
- **Strategy for GitHub**: Communicate clearly our strategy for AI in the DevSecOps space so we can share a sense of urgency to compete and be a leader in the market.
- **Quad connection**: Ensure that all key team members of the quad are connected and informed (Infra, Quality, Dev, PM, UX) to expand transparency and collaboration as groups.
  - The AI leads have started making weekly team announcements for developments across the groups. These are found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ai-powered/ai-weekly/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=all&label_name%5B%5D=AI%20Powered%20Weekly%20Updates&first_page_size=20).
