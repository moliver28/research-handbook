title: "Create:Code Creation Group Milestone Planning"
---

At GitLab and on the Code Creation team, we believe in a structured yet flexible approach to milestone planning to ensure that our engineering and product teams are aligned, focused, and able to deliver high-quality work efficiently. This page outlines our process for planning and preparing for milestones.

## Monthly Planning Issue Creation

- **Frequency and Purpose**: On the first of every month, a planning issue is created to serve as the cornerstone for that month's milestone planning.
Responsibility: The creation of the planning issue is overseen by the engineering manager (EM).
Role of Engineering and Product Managers
- **Collaboration**: The engineering manager (EM) and product manager (PM) work closely to prioritize upcoming issues for the next milestone.
- **Input from Engineers**: Engineers are encouraged to provide insights and recommendations on which issues should be considered for the upcoming milestone.

## Planning and Triage Process

- **Objective**: This process is not for issue resolution but for preparation and estimation for the upcoming milestone.
- **Issue Assignment**: During the current milestone, each engineer is assigned 1-2 upcoming issues that are likely to be included in the next milestone.
- **Time Management**: Engineers are to dedicate no more than one hour per issue for review and preparation.
    - **Review Criteria**: Engineers review the title and description of assigned issues to ensure the scope of work is clearly defined.
    - **Estimation and Comments**: If the issue is well-defined, engineers add an estimate. If additional details are needed, they should leave a comment accordingly.
    - **Issue Readiness**: Issues that are ready for development receive the "ready for development" label. Issues deemed no longer valid should be closed.

## Issues Estimation

Here are the weights we use for issue estimation:

## Capacity Planning for the Next Milestone

- **Capacity Review**: When planning the next milestone, the engineering manager evaluates the team's available capacity, taking into account PTO schedules and other commitments.
- **Issue Selection**: The EM selects top-priority issues until the capacity target is met, using the "deliverable" label to mark committed issues.

## Issue Assignment and Priority

- **Self-Assignment**: Engineers can pick any issue marked with the "deliverable" label and assign it to themselves, making these issues the top priority for the milestone.
Workflow and Label Management
- **Label Updates**: It's crucial for engineers to update the "workflow" labels accurately as issues progress from "ready for development" to "in dev" to "in review."
- **Responsibility**: Engineers are responsible for keeping the workflow labels up to date on all issues they are working on during the milestone.

This milestone planning process is designed to maximize our team's effectiveness by ensuring that everyone is aligned on priorities and responsibilities. It fosters a collaborative environment where every team member contributes to the planning process, leading to a more organized and productive development cycle.
