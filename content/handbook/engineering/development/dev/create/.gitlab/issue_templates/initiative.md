# Overview
### Description
Provide a concise description that outlines why the initiative exists (**purpose**), what specific achievements it aims for (**goals**), and why it holds significance or value (**importance**). The goal is to communicate the initiative's essence, objectives, and the broader impact it seeks to achieve. 
### Stakeholders
Stakeholders, external entities like Customer Success, Customer Support, and Marketing Leads, provide input and represent broader business needs. In contrast, the Team, comprising internal members such as Tech Lead, Engineers, and Product Managers, is actively engaged in executing tasks and achieving the goals of the initiative. Recognizing the distinction is crucial for clear communication, avoiding role overlap, and fostering effective collaboration as stakeholders guide the initiative's strategic direction, while the Team focuses on hands-on implementation, contributing to the initiative's overall success.

# Objectives
This initiatives objectives are tied to GitLab OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) through the alignment of this initiave's goals with broader organizational objectives. GitLab's OKR framework typically includes high-level objectives that align with the company's strategic priorities. These objectives, on the other hand, are more granular and are designed to contribute to the achievement of these higher-level OKRs. Each Initiative should have at least 1 related OKR.
