## Process


### Determine if the Project needs a Tech Lead

Not all projects may accommodate a Tech Lead, and the decision rests with the manager, considering the available Tech Leadership capacity within the team. The following questions are designed to assist you in evaluating whether your project would benefit from a Tech Lead.

1. Is the project technically complex? Does it require a blueprint?
1. Does it involve multiple technologies or integrations?
1. Does the project demand unique technical expertise?
1. Does the project have a high level of risk associated with technical aspects?
1. Is the success of the project critical to the overall business goals?
1. Are there complex technical decisions to be made during the project?
1. Does the project involve architectural choices that need experienced guidance?
1. Is there a tight deadline for project completion?
1. Is there a need for effective communication between technical and non-technical team members?

### Appointing a Tech Lead for a Project
The approval process is simple. The engineering manager recommends to the Director of Engineering, providing an explanation. If the project fits the criteria, a Tech Lead can be appointed. The engineering manager also suggests a lead for the project.
