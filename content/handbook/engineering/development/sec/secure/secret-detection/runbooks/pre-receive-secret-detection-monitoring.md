title: "Pre-receive secret detection monitoring"
---

> _NOTE: This is still a **draft**, more information will be added as the dashboard evolves._

### When to use this runbook?

This runbook is intended to be used when monitoring the [pre-receive secret detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/pre_receive/index.html) feature to identify and mitigate any reliability issues or performance regressions that may occur when it is enabled on Gitlab.com. The runbook can also be used to understand more about relevant dashboards below and how to improve them:

* [Pre-receive Secret Detection â€“ Overview Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/pre-receive-secret-detection-e28093-overview?orgId=1)

### What to monitor?

While the feature, in its [current form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#high-level-architecture), doesn't have any external components and is entirely encapsulated within the application server as a dependency, it does interact with a number of components as can be seen in this [push event sequence diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#push-event-detection-flow). Those components are:

* GitLab Shell (Git over SSH):
    * `git-receive-pack`
* Workhorse (Git over HTTP/S):
    * `git-receive-pack`
* Gitaly:
    * `SSHReceivePack`
    * `PostReceivePack`
    * `PreReceiveHook`
    * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
    * `ListBlobs()` RPC
    * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC
* Rails:
    * `/internal/allowed` Endpoint

Below is a sequence diagram showing the entire workflow whether a `git push` takes place over HTTP or SSH:

    end
    Gitaly->>+Workhorse/GitLab Shell: outcome of push
    Workhorse/GitLab Shell->>+User: outcome of push
```

_Note: `PreReceiveHook` is not to be confused with git's [pre-receive hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#pre-receive). In fact, the former is a [binary wrapper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-hooks) around the actual git hook. Please read more about the [hook setup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/hooks.md#hook-setup) in Gitaly's documentation._

These components are therefore the main elements we are trying to focus on when monitoring the feature.

### How we monitor the feature?

As discussed above, the functionality spans a number of components. Therefore, are three main tools we could use for monitoring the feature:

* Kibana (Logs)
    * [Staging](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net)
        * `pubsub-rails-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-shell-inf-gstg`
    * [Production](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net)
        * `pubsub-rails-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-shell-inf-gprd`
* Prometheus/Grafana (Metrics)
    * [Internal API](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/internal-api/internal-api)
    * [Gitaly](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/gitaly/gitaly-service)
    * [GitLab Shell](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/git-main/git3a-overview)
* Sentry (Error Tracking)
    * [Gitlab.com](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitlabcom)
    * [Gitaly](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitaly)
    * [Workhorse](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/workhorse-gprd)

This runbook focuses primarly on the Prometheus metrics available in Grafana, but also shares brief information about other tools and how they could be used. In later iterations, this may change as the feature grows and develops.

### How to identify and mitigate a reliability or performance issue with the feature?

The [overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/pre-receive-secret-detection-e28093-overview?orgId=1) is the main dashboard we have built to monitor the feature. That's where anyone should start to look when trying to identify reliability or performance issues.

The dashboard itself is split into 4 rows (or sections), with each containing a number of panels as below.

#### GitLab Shell (Git over SSH)

This section monitors the stability of certain operations related to the feature within `Gitlab Shell`, which is a set of executables created to handle Git SSH sessions. The tool itself does not handle SSH directly, but instead the SSH server/daemon [`gitlab-sshd`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/gitlab_sshd.html) maintain all connections with clients and calls up Rails via GitLab Shell to perform authorization or access checks. Please check [this diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/index.html#git-push-over-ssh) and [this description of a request cycle](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html#ssh-request-22) for more information on how that works.

The section can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to `git-receive-pack` operations when a `git push` operation is carried out over SSH. It is dividend into two rows/sections as follows.

**Note**: Most of available metrics for both `gitlab-shell` and `gitlab-sshd` aren't aggregated by the command used, so for a more better overview of the performance of `git-receive-pack` operation, take a look at the Kibana logs linked in those sections instead.

##### gitlab-shell

#### Workhorse (Git over HTTP/S)

This section monitors the stability of certain operations related to the feature within `Workhorse`, which is a smart reverse proxy intended to handle resource-intensive and long-running requests. It intercepts all HTTP requests and either propagates them without changing or handles them itself by performing additional logic. Please check [this diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/workhorse/handlers.html#git-push) and [this description of a request cycle](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html#web-request-80443) for more information on how that works.

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/workhorse/handlers.html#git-push

#### Gitaly

This section monitors the stability of `gitaly`, a tool providing high-level RPC access to `git` repositories. We focus in this section on the hooks and RPCs used by the feature. This can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related any of them.

The section is divided into four sub-areas as follows, with most focus being on latency.

1. GitLab Shell <=> Gitaly:
    * `SSHReceivePack`
1. Workhorse <=> Gitaly:
    * `PostReceivePack`.
1. Gitaly <=> Rails API:
    * Gitaly / Before `/internal/allowed`:
        * `PreReceiveHook`.
    * Gitaly / During `/internal/allowed`:
        * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
        * `ListBlobs()` RPC
        * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC

Interesting Metrics:

- Gitaly GitLab API Latency Sum / Count (gitaly_gitlab_api_latency_seconds_sum/gitaly_gitlab_api_latency_seconds_count)
- Gitaly Total bytes of git-pack-objects served (gitaly_pack_objects_served_bytes_total)
