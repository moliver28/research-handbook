title: "Pre-receive secret detection monitoring"
---

> _NOTE: This is still an **early draft**, more information will be added as the dashboard evolves._

### When to use this runbook?

This runbook is intended to be used when monitoring the [pre-receive secret detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/pre_receive/index.html) feature to identify and mitigate any reliability issues or performance regressions that may occur when it is enabled on Gitlab.com. The runbook can also be used to understand more about relevant dashboards below and how to improve them:

* [Pre-receive Secret Detection â€“ Overview Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/pre-receive-secret-detection-e28093-overview?orgId=1)

### What to monitor?

While the feature, in its [current form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#high-level-architecture), doesn't have any external components and is entirely encapsulated within the application server as a dependency, it does interact with a number of components as can be seen in this [push event sequence diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#push-event-detection-flow). Those components are:

* GitLab Shell (Git over SSH):
    * `git-receive-pack`
* GitLab Workhorse (Git over HTTP/S):
    * `git-receive-pack`
* Gitaly:
    * `PostReceivePack`
    * `PreReceiveHook`
    * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
    * `ListBlobs()` RPC
    * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC
* Rails:
    * `/internal/allowed` Endpoint

_Note: `PreReceiveHook` is not to be confused with git's [pre-receive hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#pre-receive). In fact, it's a [binary wrapper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-hooks) around the actual git hook. Please read more about the [hook setup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/hooks.md#hook-setup) in Gitaly's documentation._

These components are therefore the main elements we are trying to focus on when monitoring the feature.

### How we monitor the feature?

As discussed above, the functionality spans a number of components. Therefore, are three main tools we could use for monitoring the feature:

* Kibana (Logs)
    * [Staging](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net)
        * `pubsub-rails-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-shell-inf-gstg`
    * [Production](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net)
        * `pubsub-rails-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-shell-inf-gprd`
* Prometheus/Grafana (Metrics)
    * [Internal API](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/internal-api/internal-api)
    * [Gitaly](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/gitaly/gitaly-service)
    * [GitLab Shell](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/git-main/git3a-overview)
* Sentry (Error Tracking)
    * [Gitlab.com](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitlabcom)
    * [Gitaly](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitaly)
    * [Workhorse](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/workhorse-gprd)

This runbook focuses primarly on the Prometheus metrics available in Grafana, but also shares brief information about other tools and how they could be used. In later iterations, this may change as the feature grows and develops.

### How to identify and mitigate a reliability or performance issue with the feature?

The [overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/pre-receive-secret-detection-e28093-overview?orgId=1) is the main dashboard we have built to monitor the feature. That's where anyone should start to look when trying to identify reliability or performance issues.

The dashboard itself is split into 4 rows (or sections), with each containing a number of panels as below.

#### GitLab Shell (Git over SSH)

This section monitors the stability of certain operations related to the feature within `Gitlab Shell`, which is a set of executables created to handle Git SSH sessions. The tool itself does not handle SSH directly, but instead the SSH server/daemon [`gitlab-sshd`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/gitlab_sshd.html) maintain all connections with clients and calls up Rails via GitLab Shell to perform authorization or access checks. Please check [this diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/index.html#git-push-over-ssh) and [this description of a request cycle](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html#ssh-request-22) for more information on how that works.

The section can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to `git-receive-pack` operations when a git push operation is carried out over SSH.

#### GitLab Workhorse (Git over HTTP/S)

This section monitors the stability of certain operations related to the feature within `Workhorse`, which is a smart reverse proxy intended to handle resource-intensive and long-running requests. It intercepts all HTTP requests and either propagates them without changing or handles them itself by performing additional logic. Please check [this diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/workhorse/handlers.html#git-push) and [this description of a request cycle](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html#web-request-80443) for more information on how that works.

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/workhorse/handlers.html#git-push

The section can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to `git-receive-pack` operations when a git push operation is carried out over HTTP/S.

**Processed `git-receive-pack` Requests**

This panel displays the number of HTTP requests that have been processed by `workhorse` over time, increasing in range of 24 hours. The panel partitions these requests by the HTTP verb/method and response code. This panel can be used to determine if the amount of `git-receive-pack` requests with a response code that isn't `200` had increased recently, indicating an issue with processing such requests.

*Panel Information*

* Metric used: `gitlab_workhorse_git_http_requests`
* Labels:
  * `exported_service` = `git-receive-pack`
  * `env` = `gprd`
  * `stage` = `main`
  * `code` != `0`
* Operations:
  * Increase: `range | 24h`
  * Sum:
    * Label: `code`
    * Label: `method`
* Legend:
  * `{{code}} | {{method}}`

**Total Established Gitaly Connections**

This panel displays the total number of `Gitaly` connections that have been established by `workhorse` at a given time. This panel can be used to determine if there's a sudden drop in connections between both components, which may indicate a performance or an availability issue.

*Panel Information*

* Metric used: `gitlab_workhorse_gitaly_connections_total`
* Labels:
  * `env` = `gprd`
  * `stage` = `main`
* Operations:
  * Count:
    * Label: `status`
* Legend:
  * `{{status}}`

**Average Latency for `/.git/git-receive-pack` Request [All Nodes]**

This panel displays the average latency (duration) in seconds for the `/.git/git-receive-pack` request for all nodes running `workhorse`. This panel can be used to determine if there is an increase in response times for that specific request, which could indicate performance degradation issue if it surpassed a certain thershold.

*Panel Information*

* Metrics used:
    * `gitlab_workhorse_http_request_duration_seconds_sum`
    * `gitlab_workhorse_http_request_duration_seconds_count`
* Labels:
  * `env` = `gprd`
  * `stage` = `main`
  * `route` = `^/.+\\.git/git-receive-pack\\z` (double escaping is used for backslash )
* Operations:
  * Divison: `/`
  * Rate: `range | 1h`
  * Sum:
    * Label: `node`
* Legend:
  * Auto

#### Gitaly

This section monitors the stability of `gitaly`, more specifically the hooks and RPCs used by the feature. This can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to any of those hooks and RPCs.

The section is divided into two sub-areas as follows, with most focus being on latency.

1. Workhorse <=> Gitaly:
    * `PostReceivePack`.
1. Gitaly <=> Rails API:
    * Gitaly / Before `/internal/allowed`:
        * `PreReceiveHook`.
    * Gitaly / During `/internal/allowed`:
        * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
        * `ListBlobs()` RPC
        * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC

Interesting Metrics:

- Gitaly GitLab API Latency Sum / Count (gitaly_gitlab_api_latency_seconds_sum/gitaly_gitlab_api_latency_seconds_count)
- Gitaly Total bytes of git-pack-objects served (gitaly_pack_objects_served_bytes_total)

#### Rails

Placeholder, will be added soon.

### How to contribute to relevant dashboards?

Dashboards discussed in this runbook can be improved as follows.

#### When a new component is utilised by the feature

If a new component is utilised by the feature, please follow the steps below.

* Identify endpoints or services the feature interacts with in the component.
* Explore metrics available for the endpoint or service.
* If no metrics are available, consider [creating them](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/) to monitor the performance of the endpoint/service.
* Create a new row for the component in the dashboard you are editing.
* Add as many panels as for available metrics in the new row. Use your best judgement on what is should be added.
* Create a merge request updating this runbook with information about the panel. Use panels above for guidance.

#### When a component is no longer relevant

If a component is no longer relevant, please remove its corresponding row from the dashboard.
