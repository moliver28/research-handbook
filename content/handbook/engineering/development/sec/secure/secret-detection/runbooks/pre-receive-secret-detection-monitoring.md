title: "Pre-receive secret detection monitoring"
---

> _NOTE: This is still an **early draft**, more information will be added as the dashboard is created soon._

### When to use this runbook?

This runbook is intended to be used when monitoring the [pre-receive secret detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/pre_receive.html) feature to identify and mitigate any reliability issues or performance regressions that may occur when it is enabled on Gitlab.com. The runbook can also be used to understand more about relevant dashboards and how to improve them:

* [Pre-receive Secret Detection â€“ Overview Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/pre-receive-secret-detection-e28093-overview?orgId=1)

### What to monitor?

While the feature, in its [current form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#high-level-architecture), doesn't have any external components and is entirely encapsulated within the application server as a dependency, it does interact with a number of components as can be seen in this [push event sequence diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#push-event-detection-flow). Those components are:

* Workhorse:
    * `git-receive-pack`
* Gitaly:
    * `PostReceivePack`
    * `PreReceiveHook`
    * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
    * `ListBlobs()` RPC
    * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC
* Rails:
    * `/internal/allowed` Endpoint

_Note: `PreReceiveHook` is not to be confused with git's [pre-receive hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#pre-receive). In fact, it's a [binary wrapper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-hooks) around the actual git hook. Please read more about the [hook setup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/hooks.md#hook-setup) in Gitaly's documentation._

These components are therefore the main elements we are trying to focus on when monitoring the feature.

### How we monitor the feature?

As discussed above, the functionality spans a number of components. Therefore, are three main tools we could use for monitoring the feature:

* Kibana (Logs)
    * [Staging](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net)
        * `pubsub-rails-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gstg`
        * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gstg`
    * [Production](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net)
        * `pubsub-rails-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gprd`
        * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gprd`
* Prometheus/Grafana (Metrics)
    * [Internal API](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/internal-api/internal-api)
    * [Gitaly](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/gitaly/gitaly-service)
* Sentry (Error Tracking)
    * [Gitlab.com](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitlabcom)
    * [Gitaly](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitaly)
    * [Workhorse](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/workhorse-gprd)

This runbook focuses primarly on the Prometheus metrics available in Grafana, but also shares brief information about other tools and how they could be used. In later iterations, this may change as the feature grows and develops.

### How to identify and mitigate a reliability or performance issue with the feature?

The [overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/pre-receive-secret-detection-e28093-overview?orgId=1) is the main dashboard we have built to monitor the feature. That's where anyone should start to look when trying to identify reliability or performance issues.

The dashboard itself is split into 3 rows (or sections), with each containing a number of panels as below.

#### Workhorse

This section monitors the stability of `workhorse` in general and is used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to `git-receive-pack` operations.

**Processed `git-receive-pack` Requests**

This panel displays the number of HTTP requests that have been processed by `workhorse` over time, increasing in range of 24 hours. The panel partitions these requests by the HTTP verb/method and response code. This panel can be used to determine if the amount of `git-receive-pack` requests with a response code that isn't `200` had increased recently, indicating an issue with processing such requests.

_Panel Information_

* Metric used: `gitlab_workhorse_git_http_requests`
* Labels:
  * `exported_service` = `git-receive-pack`
  * `env` = `gprd`
  * `stage` = `main`
  * `code` != `0`
* Operations:
  * Increase: `range | 24h`
  * Sum:
    * Label: `code`
    * Label: `method`
* Legend:
  * `{{code}} | {{method}}`

**Total Established Gitaly Connections**

This panel displays the total number of `Gitaly` connections that have been established by `workhorse` at a given time. This panel can be used to determine if there's a sudden drop in connections between both components, which may indicate a performance or an availability issue.

_Panel Information_

* Metric used: `gitlab_workhorse_gitaly_connections_total`
* Labels:
  * `env` = `gprd`
  * `stage` = `main`
* Operations:
  * Count:
    * Label: `status`
* Legend:
  * `{{status}}`

**Average Latency for `/.git/git-receive-pack` Request [All Nodes]**

This panel displays the average latency (duration) in seconds for the `/.git/git-receive-pack` request for all nodes running `workhorse`. This panel can be used to determine if there is an increase in response times for that specific request, which could indicate performance degradation issue if it surpassed a certain thershold.

_Panel Information_

* Metrics used:
    * `gitlab_workhorse_http_request_duration_seconds_sum`
    * `gitlab_workhorse_http_request_duration_seconds_count`
* Labels:
  * `env` = `gprd`
  * `stage` = `main`
  * `route` = `^/.+\\.git/git-receive-pack\\z` (double escaping is used for backslash )
* Operations:
  * Divison: `/`
  * Rate: `range | 1h`
  * Sum:
    * Label: `node`
* Legend:
  * Auto

### Where else to look for help?

If you're unsure, you can always ask for help in `#g_secure-secret-detection` channel.

### How to improve this runbook?

The runbook needs to be updated as the feature evolves and progresses. Please follow guidelines below to keep it updated.

#### When a panel is updated in a dashboard

If a panel is updated in a dashboard, please update the panel information and description as needed.

#### When a new panel is added

If a new panel is created in a dashboard, please add the name, description, and information using the same format outlined below.

```
**PANEL NAME IN BOLD**

A few sentences describing what the panel does and what it could be used for to identify a performance regression or reliability issue.

_Panel Information_

* Metric used: `NAME_OF_METRIC_USED`
* Labels:
  * `LIST_OF_LABELS_USED_TO_FILTER_BY_IN_KEY_AND_VALUE`
* Operations:
  * `LIST_OF_OPERATIONS_APPLIED_ON_DATA`
* Legend:
  * `LEGEND_USED_IF_NOT_AUTOMATIC`
```

#### When a panel is removed

In case a panel is removed from the dashboard, please consider removing the corresponding section from this runbook.

### How to contribute to relevant dashboards?

Dashboards discussed in this runbook can be improved as follows.

#### When a new component is utilised by the feature

If a new component is utilised by the feature, please follow the steps below.

* Identify endpoints or services the feature interacts with in the component.
* Explore metrics available for the endpoint or service.
* If no metrics are available, consider [creating them](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/) to monitor the performance of the endpoint/service.
* Create a new row for the component in the dashboard you are editing.
* Add as many panels as for available metrics in the new row. Use your best judgement on what is should be added.
* Create a merge request updating this runbook with information about the panel. Use panels above for guidance.

#### When a component is no longer relevant

If a component is no longer relevant, please remove its corresponding row from the dashboard.
