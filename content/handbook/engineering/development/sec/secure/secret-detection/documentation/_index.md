title: "Secret Detection Documentation"

## Overview

Documentation is an important part of delivering features and capabilities to
our users and customers. This process is intended to make writing effective documentation easier and efficient for our team.

This documentation should help you answer the following questions:
1. When should I create documentation?
1. What should I document?
1. Where should I put the documentation?
1. How do I write the documentation?
1. How do I let people know about the documentation?

## When to write documentation

The default should be to always write documentation. The only time it may be okay to
skip writing documentation would be if a situation or project is a one-off or
prototype.

## What should be documented

First, when considering this, you should consider the intended audience.

Is the documentation intedend for
- end users or customers?
- GitLab teammates or external engineers?
- managers or C-level executives?

Regardless of the audience, the documentation should give an overview and the
context for the feature, process, decision, etc.

For end users and customers, the documentation also provide steps to set up and
configure the feature, and samples or examples. Additionally, it should provide
in-depth reference for configuration of the feature.

For an engineering audience, the aim is to give the engineer enough information so they can make educated changes and minimize the risk of those changes.
We should document the why of designs, decisions, and processes that we implement and what options we rejected and why. Further, diagramming data flow, or interactions should be done when possible.

For management, our goal should be to give enough non-technical information to
allow them to make informed decisions that could affect any level of the
company.

## Where to document

For most processes, non-technical, or project-agnostic topics, documentation should be in the
handbook.

For technical information and project-specific usage or configuration should be
made in the project it pertains to.

## How to write documentation

1. Define the questions the documentation should answer
1. Create the outline of the page(s)
1. Get feedback on the questions and outline and update accordingly
1. Fill out the document's sections
1. Have teammates and stakeholders review and update the documentation
   accordingly
1. Publish documentation
1. Notify stakeholders via Slack and or meetings

If possible and appropriate, we should also create a video demo of the documented features and uses.

## How to publicize the documentation

This depends on the audience:
- For engineering or management audiences, you should make an announcement in
the proper Slack channel and possibly the Engineering Week in Review document.
- For customers, you can let the customer service organization know via Slack.
Additionally, a release note addition could be possible.
