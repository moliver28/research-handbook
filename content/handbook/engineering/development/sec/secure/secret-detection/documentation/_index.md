1. Create the outline of the page(s)
1. Get feedback on the questions and outline and update accordingly
1. Fill out the document's sections
1. Have teammates and stakeholders review and update the documentation
   accordingly

If possible and appropriate, we should also create a video demo of the documented features and uses.
