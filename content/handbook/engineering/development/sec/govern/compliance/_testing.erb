We aim to uphold [GitLab's principle of fostering an environment where Quality is everyone's responsibility](/handbook/engineering/quality/#our-principles).
Testing is an essential part of our [product development workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) and
[code review process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#quality).
