We are also [exploring ideas, existing issues and user feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/service-desk/meta/-/issues/2). Please feel free to contribute.

### Current focus

#### Customizable e-mail address on a per-project basis

**Custom email address for Service Desk is planned to be released in Beta in GitLab 16.4 and is already available on GitLab SaaS.**

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_moD5U3xcQs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

Right now GitLab does not support a fully customized and professional e-mail experience throughout the
communication with the customer. You can add e-mail forwarding from your own e-mail address to the Service Desk
intake e-mail address, but the sender of the inquiry will always receive answers from the default GitLab
instance address. That is especially a show-stopper for gitlab.com customers as they do not want to have
GitLab e-mail addresses in their customer communication.

We are actively working on [bringing configurable e-mail addresses on a per-project basis to GitLab Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329990).
The [proposed solution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329990#note_1192437371) will involve little changes to existing
functionality and we will iterate on that to make it even easier to use in the future.

Customers will need to configure e-mail forwarding from their desired Service Desk e-mail address to the
provided Service Desk intake e-mail address by the GitLab instance. They will then add SMTP credentials for that address so
the GitLab instance will be able to send e-mails on behalf of that configured e-mail address.
We will also allow `Reply-To` e-mail headers to use the configured e-mail address to deliver a complete package.

If you have questions or would like to share feedback, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329990).

### Released features

#### Native attachments for Service Desk emails

Native attachments for Service Desk emails allow external participants like the issue author to receive uploads to a
comment as a native email attachment (up to 10MBs). This is great because previously based on your project settings
or instance configuration external participants could not access media assets via the provided links in certain scenarios.

**Shipped in gitLab 15.10**. See the [release post item](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/03/22/gitlab-15-10-released/#native-attachments-for-service-desk-emails) and the [feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11733).
This SEG did not implement the feature, but mentored the team, designed the solution and published the feature.

#### Obfuscate email addresses of Service Desk issues based on user role

Making sure private data is protected no matter where a Service Desk issue ends up. If you do not have at least the reporter role in a GitLab project or group, you won’t be able to view the email address of the author of a Service Desk issue and issue email participants in general. No matter whether it’s a public or private project or the issue is confidential or not.

**Shipped in GitLab 15.9**. See the [release post item](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/02/22/gitlab-15-9-released/#redact-service-desk-email-addresses-in-issues)

### Background

We have a [Service Desk offering](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/service_management/service_desk) in GitLab that we'd like
to make an integral part of the GitLab support workflow. We have early usage, a community of prolific contributors and
a new team ([Respond group in Monitor stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#respond-group)) onboarding to
the new domain.

### Product Development Group affinity

- [Respond group in Monitor stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#respond-group) owns Service Desk and currently
  onboards to the new domain
- [Project management group in Plan stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#project-management-group) as Service Desk issues use all of GitLabs planning functionality
