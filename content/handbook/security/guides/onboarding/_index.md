title: Security Guide for Onboarding
---

Congratulations on joining GitLab! This page is dedicated to the IT and Security onboarding experience.

We use many applications at GitLab and provide you with the latest hardware to enable you to complete your work to the best of your ability!

## Need Help?

While it may seen a little bit overwhelming at the start, the Corporate Security Helpdesk team is here to make the process as easy as possible!

We host a (optional) weekly onboarding call every Tuesday (check your calendar) to help new team members with MacBook setup.

Please visit the [Corporate Security Support](/handbook/security/corporate/support) handbook page if you need help. For most questions, simply ask in the `#it_help` Slack channel.
