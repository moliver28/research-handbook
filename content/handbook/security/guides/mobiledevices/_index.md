### Android Biometrics Handling and Storage

Mobile phone models have various levels of security when handling biometric and other critical data.

In particular, certain Samsung andriod devices have a dedicated, high security biometric and key handling hardware subsystem known as Knox Vault.

Samsung Knox Vault is a subsystem on a chip that is not based on Android and that the Android OS does not have full access to at the API level. It includes encrypted storage. [Here is an accessible (not too techie) reasonable video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSBZXC4hel8) if you want to know more.

All of Samsungs advanced security capabilities carry the "Knox" brand name, so it is important to know that not all Samsung mobile devices have Knox **Vault**. While Vault has previously focused on premium phones and tablets, it is now making its way into the less expensive lines (e.g. the A55 has Knox Vault)

Here is the place to learn exactly what devices have Knox Vault - on the left navigation of this page, select the "Knox Vault" radio button to filter the list for devices that have this feature.
