## Overview

This page aims to outline the automation vision, goals and priorities as they relate to compliance. Automation in the compliance space can take many forms:

- Do you want to automate manual administrative processes, just removing clicks?
- Do you want to automate testing activities but produce a similar workbook style output?
- Do you want to automate monitoring of controls so control failures trigger alerts and prompt responsive action?
- Do you want to use automation to aggregate data better such as monitoring controls but without responsive action to identify key trends?
- Do you want to use automation to block events that would trigger control failures?
- Even more questions!

All of these questions and more may be considered when defining vision, goals and priorities as working through these questions and corresponding phases will be an iterative processes. There are pros and cons to be considered in each phase of automation maturity:

- Using automation to block failure events seems like the best, that way we never have control failures, right? But if the automation hinders the teams responsible for completing the work, is that the right answer? Perhaps so, perhaps not. 
- Instead perhaps we should instead monitor controls and not block anything but just quickly respond to any alerts with prompt action? That's less impactful to other teams but still minimizes the impact of a control failure. That might require significant time investment from people to monitor which we may not have. Is that the right answer? Perhaps so, perhaps not.
- Maybe instead we should just see what automated testing we can build that'll output a testing workbook for us and we'll look at it on a regular cadence similar to when we manually test? That'll still save some time and won't impact other teams adversely. But that means control failures may go unnoticed for longer periods and if the automation is used infrequently, how do we know the automation is capturing everything we'd expect to see as processes adapt? Is that the right answer? Perhaps so, perhaps not.

There won't necessarily be a one-size-fits-all approach for compliance automation and we should expect iteration always but defining vision, goals and priorities will help inform where we're building toward and reduce ambiguity in expectations.
