## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Engaging Threat Intelligence

Please follow our [RFI process](#requests-for-information-rfi) to contact the team.

For a less formal discussion, you can find us in Slack in the `#sd_security_threat_intel` channel.

## <i class="fas fa-rocket" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Our Vision

Empower GitLab to make informed, intelligence-driven decisions that keep our company and customers secure, while setting a new standard for transparency and collaboration across the industry.

## <i class="fas fa-compass" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Our Mission Statement

We work hard to stay ahead of emerging threats. Our mission is to provide actionable intelligence that empowers GitLab to make informed, proactive decisions about security.

When new threats emerge, we aim to quickly assess the risks, evaluate our defenses, and provide clear recommendations for action.

We do this by continuously monitoring the threat landscape, analyzing risks, and building and maintaining relationships with industry peers. These connections give us access to timely, unique insights that are not otherwise available. We focus on extracting the most relevant information to our organization, allowing us to deliver clear, concise reports that recommend immediate actions.

By staying vigilant and sharing targeted intelligence, we strive to help GitLab anticipate challenges, move swiftly, and protect our platform and customers.

## <i class="fas fa-users" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> The Team

### Current Structure

The Threat Intelligence initiative is driven by cross-functional participants from SIRT and the Red Team, who dedicate 10-20% of their time to the program while still prioritizing their primary roles. They focus on building capabilities, delivering actionable intelligence, and demonstrating early results.

### Current Priorities

The initiative's current priorities are:

1. **Building connections**: Establishing relationships with industry peers, government entities, and other experts who specialize in relevant threats.
2. **Delivering actionable threat briefings**: Preparing and presenting concise, actionable [threat briefings](#threat-briefings) that inform GitLab of relevant threats, their potential impact, and recommended actions.
3. **Refining reporting processes**: Continuously improving reporting templates and processes to ensure clear, consistent, and efficient communication of threat intelligence findings.

As the program matures, we will expand our focus to additional service offerings outlined below.

### Threat Intelligence Reports

Reports are the foundation of our Threat Intelligence program and are always actionable. We use GitLab.com to write the reports, enabling collaboration and allowing direct linking to recommendations and results.

All reports, regardless of type, consistently:

- Include linked issues with clearly defined next steps to address each topic covered
- Answer the following questions for each threat addressed:
  - How is this relevant to GitLab?
  - How well is GitLab prepared to deal with this threat today?
  - What steps is GitLab taking to better handle this threat?

The specific reports types we offer are described below.

#### Flash Reports

Flash Reports are delivered on an ad-hoc basis in response to rapidly emerging threats. They focus on a single topic, generally a specific threat actor, campaign, or vulnerability.

These reports help GitLab make quick decisions to protect our customers and our organization.

Recommendations linked to Flash Reports are often time-sensitive and critical. They are leveraged for activities like:

- Rapid iterations to security controls and detection capabilities
- Threat hunting
- Security communications
- Purple Team Flash Operations

Flash Reports use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/flash_report.md?ref_type=heads).

#### Threat Briefings

Threat Briefings offer regular, high-level updates on the evolving threat landscape. They highlight the most relevant trends, actors, and campaigns that could affect GitLab in the coming weeks or months.

These reports help team members stay informed, vigilant, and prepared.

Recommendations linked to Threat Briefings are not as time-sensitive as those from a Flash Report. They are leveraged for activities like:

- Product roadmap and prioritization
- Standard iterations to security controls and detection capabilities
- Training on security awareness and job-specific skills
- Purchasing decisions and vendor evaluations

Threat Briefings are produced monthly using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/threat_briefing.md?ref_type=heads) and include a live presentation with a Q&A session.

### Threat Actor Tracking

Threat Actor Tracking is an ongoing effort where we closely monitor the threat actors that pose the greatest risk to GitLab. By continuously monitoring their activities, tactics, and techniques, we develop a better understanding of their motivations and capabilities.

This intelligence helps us anticipate their next moves and proactively strengthen our defenses. It also helps us attribute early indicators to these groups, giving us a heads-up when they are actively targeting us.

Threat Actor Tracking is done inside our Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP).

### Requests For Information (RFI)

RFIs allow GitLab team members to request our help in analyzing threats and making intelligence-informed decisions. Team Members can [open an issue in our tracker using the RFI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-issue-tracker/-/issues/new).

Some examples where an RFI can provide value:

- Investigating active security incidents
- Decisions on product security features and functionality
- Third-party vendor and product evaluations

Supporting S1 incidents will always take priority over all other work.

Requests for Information use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/rfi.md?ref_type=heads).

## <i class="fas fa-chart-simple" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How We Measure Success

We measure the success of our threat intelligence program using three key metrics: Adoption Rate, Attribution, and Impact. We track these metrics using GitLab.com issues and custom labels.

1. Adoption Rate: Measures the extent to which our intelligence-driven recommendations are accepted and implemented.
2. Attribution: Measures the accuracy, relevance, and source of our intelligence by tracking how often it is validated by real-life events.
3. Impact: Measures how often our intelligence helps prevent incidents, detect attacks, and improve response times.

Monitoring these metrics helps us continually refine our services, prioritize high-impact activities, and demonstrate the value of our program.

### Metric Labels
