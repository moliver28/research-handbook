description: GitLab Security Threat Intelligence Team Overview

Empowering GitLab with actionable insights to keep our organization and customers secure.

## <i class="fas fa-rocket" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Our Vision

Help GitLab make informed, intelligence-driven decisions that keep our company and customers secure, while setting a new standard for transparency and collaboration across the industry.

### Our Mission Statement

We will provide timely, relevant, and actionable intelligence that integrates into our security operations and broader business decision-making.

When a new threat makes headlines, we'll already have answers. We'll know if GitLab is at risk, how well we can detect and prevent an attack, and what we're doing to prepare for one.

This starts with proactively identifying and assessing threats and risks most relevant to our customers, our product, and our organization. We will deliver this information in clear and concise formats, adding context and recommending immediate actions to protect against emerging threats.

Our team will develop and maintain relationships with industry peers, keeping a pulse on trends and helping to secure the industry as a whole.

By executing on this mission, we will:

- Foster a culture of threat awareness and intelligence sharing across the organization.
- Build and maintain the trust and confidence of our customers and team members.
- Help meet the broader objectives of our security organization by adapting rapidly to changes in the threat landscape.

### Threat Intelligence Reports

Reports are the foundation of our Threat Intelligence program and will always be actionable. We use GitLab.com to write the reports - this makes collaboration easy and allows us to directly link the intelligence to the results it drives.

All reports, regardless of type, will always:

- Include linked issues with clearly defined next-steps to address each topic covered
- Answer the following questions for each threat addressed:
  - How is this relevant to GitLab?
  - How well is GitLab prepared to deal with this threat today?
  - What steps is GitLab taking to better handle this threat?

#### Flash Reports

Flash Reports are delivered on an ad-hoc basis, in response to a rapidly emerging threat. They focus on a single topic - generally a specific threat actor, campaign, or vulnerability.

These reports help GitLab make quick decisions to protect our customers and our organization.

Recommendations linked to Flash Reports are often time-sensitive and critical. They are leveraged for activities like:

- Rapid iterations to security controls and detection capabilities
- Threat hunting
- Security communications
- Purple Team Flash Operations

Flash Reports use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/flash_report.md?ref_type=heads).

#### Threat Briefings

Threat Briefings offer regular, high-level updates on the evolving threat landscape. They highlight the most relevant trends, actors, and campaigns that could affect GitLab in coming weeks or months.

These reports help team members stay informed, vigilant, and prepared.

Recommendations links to Threat Briefings are not as time-sensitive as those from a Flash Report. They are leveraged for activities like:

- Product roadmap and prioritization
- Standard iterations to security controls and detection capabilities
- Training on security awareness and job-specific skills
- Purchasing decisions and vendor evaluations

Threat Briefings use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/threat_briefing.md?ref_type=heads).

### Threat Actor Tracking

This is an ongoing effort, where we closely monitor the threat actors that pose the greatest risk to GitLab. By continuously monitoring their activities, tactics, and techniques, we develop a better understanding of their motivations and capabilities.

This intelligence helps us anticipate their next move and proactively strengthen our defenses. It also helps us attribute early indicators to these groups, giving us a heads up they are actively targeting us.

Threat Actor Tracking is done inside our Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP).

### Requests For Information

We're here to help you analyze threats and make intelligence-informed decisions. GitLab team members can [open an issue in our tracker using the RFI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-issue-tracker/-/issues/new).

Some examples where an RFI can provide value:

- Investigating active security incidents
- Decisions on product security features and functionality
- Third-party vendor and product evaluations

Requests for Information use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/rfi.md?ref_type=heads).
