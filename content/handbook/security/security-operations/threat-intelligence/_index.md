Empowering GitLab with actionable insights to keep our organization and customers secure.

## <i class="fas fa-rocket" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Our Vision

Help GitLab make informed, intelligence-driven decisions that keep our company and customers secure, while setting a new standard for transparency and collaboration across the industry.

### Our Mission Statement

We will provide timely, relevant, and actionable intelligence that integrates into our security operations and broader business decision-making.

When a new threat makes headlines, we'll already have answers. We'll know if GitLab is at risk, how well we can detect and prevent an attack, and what we're doing to prepare for one.

This starts with proactively identifying and assessing threats and risks most relevant to our customers, our product, and our organization. We will deliver this information in clear and concise formats, adding context and recommending immediate actions to protect against emerging threats.

Our team will develop and maintain relationships with industry peers, keeping a pulse on trends and helping to secure the industry as a whole.

By executing on this mission, we will:

- Foster a culture of threat awareness and intelligence sharing across the organization.
- Build and maintain the trust and confidence of our customers and team members.
- Help meet the broader objectives of our security organization by adapting rapidly to changes in the threat landscape.

### Threat Intelligence Flash Reports

Flash Reports are delivered on an ad-hoc basis, in response to a rapidly emerging threat. They focus on a single topic - generally a specific threat actor, campaign, or vulnerability.

These reports help GitLab make quick decisions to protect our customers and our organization.
