## What are vulnerability remediation SLAs?

At GitLab we commit to resolving vulnerabilities in our software and our systems within specific time limits. Typically these limits are referred to as Vulnerability Remediation SLAs (Service Level Agreements) or SLOs (Service Level Objectives) depending on whether or not the time limit is contractually agreed with a third party or not, respectively. In most cases our remediation goals are objectives, however the term SLA is used to keep things simple and consistent.

## Why are vulnerability remedation SLAs important?

Remediation SLAs set reasonable expectations, based on the criticality of a vulnerability and expected impact, for how quickly GitLab users and customers can expect a security vulnerability to be mitigated. Vulnerabilities and the work required to address them require work to mitigate, and like all work, this must be prioritised. Severity and impact-based SLAs are the simplest way to prioritise this work whilst delivering the most positive impact to the security of our products, systems and in turn the security of our customers and users.

## What does an SLA measure?

An SLA in the context of a security vulnerability measures the time it takes to resolve or mitigate a vulnerability. The definition of resolution and mitigation varies based on the vulnerability, where it was detected, and if it can be feasibly addressed without impacting the availability or stability of impacted GitLab assets. The requirements and definition of fixed are naturally different for vulnerabilities in code, vulnerabilities in installed software on servers, or bundled code in containers, for example. All of these types of assets & the vulnerabilities which impact them must have the following in common, if an SLA is to apply to them:

1. All vulnerabilities must be able to be fixed
1. All vulnerabilities must be able to be detected
1. GitLab must be responsible for the asset impacted by a vulnerability

For example, we cannot apply an SLA to a component or asset we are not responsible for - as we are not able to make commitments or make plans to address a vulnerability within a specific timeframe. In the case of dependencies we bundle (in our code or images) or install (on systems we are responsible for) we are however responsible for deploying updates which address vulnerabilities, so an SLA is releveant here once an update is actually available. For vulnerabilities directly present due to configuration of systems or vulnerabilities in code which GitLab is responsible for, we are directly responsible and the SLA is applicable regardless of when a mitigation or remediation is available - as we are also responsible for defining the mitigation or remediation for the vulnerability as part of overall remediation of the vulnerability.

Where vulnerabilities are present in code or images GitLab is directly responsible for (i.e. not in dependencies) then the SLA will measure the time from initial detection of the vulnerability through to when a mitigation is generally available to GitLab users and customers.

Where vulnerabilities are present in code dependencies, image components or pacakges on systems GitLab is responsible for, including installations of GitLab-provided images and packages on GitLab managed systems, the SLA measures the time from an updated package or image becoming available, through to when the updated image or package has been deployed to impacted systems. In the context of managed systems, the SLA measures specifically the time from initial detection through to resolution on a per-system basis, so this needs to be tracked on a per-system per-vulnerability basis to measure SLAs.

In circumstances where a vulnerability exists in code or images GitLab is responsible for (such as supported images and packages used for deploying GitLab), which are deployed to systems managed by GitLab on behalf of customers (such as [GitLab Dedicated](https://about.gitlab.com/dedicated/)), the SLA for initial vulnerability mitigation and resolution in GitLab code, packages and images which are deployed to managed environments does not include the time taken to deploy fixed packages to managed environments. The SLA to release fixed packages and images addressing a vulnerability in GitLab code or images and the SLA for taking the newly released packages, and the SLA for deploying fixed packages and images to environments managed by GitLab on the behalf of customers are separate SLAs with distinct timelines. The SLA to mitigate and remediate a finding in GitLab code or images starts upon detection or report of a vulnerability in GitLab code or images, and ends when the updated packages or images are made available to the GitLab team members responsible for environments managed by GitLab on behalf of customers. The SLA for remediating the vulnerabilities in those managed environments begins upon availability of fixed packages and images, and ends when the packages or images have been deployed to the managed environment. This distinction is made to ensure GitLab can maintain our commitments to availability and stability of managed environments.

Given the typical different impact of different vulnerabilities across GitLab's code, images and systems, impact and therefore SLA may be different for the same vulnerability across different packages and components impacted by a distinct known vulnerability. SLAs need to be tracked at the component/package level in addition to per image or per system level to ensure impact can be accurately tracked and SLA accurately measured.
