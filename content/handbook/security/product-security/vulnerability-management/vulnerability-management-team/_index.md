This handbook page describes how the Vulnerability Management team works on a day to day, quarter to quarter basis.
We recognise this process is iterative and requires regular introspection to ensure we are always improving and not stagnating in our approach.


## Planning

Prior to a milestone beginning, the team conveens to review the expected outcome and the work required to accomplish this. We review our ability to deliver this work within the milestone and commit/adjust to issues to fit.

#### How do we breakdown quarterly items into appropriately sized issues?

Currently we review the work as we go, creating smaller issues when needed. We hope to do this at a regular cadence in the near future.


#### Will we use a kanban board or similar? (this allows work in progress limits ect)?

We don't know this quite yet, but we do know that labels will be key to this succeding.


### Refinement & Sizing

The team currently performs adhoc refinement & sizing on work items without a defined weighting scale. We would like to implement a defined weighted scale in the near future to allow a better understanding of team capacity & commitment.
These steps are used as guidelines:
1. Check the issue for sufficient information to accomplish the desired outcome.
1. Ensure the desired outcome is sufficiently understood and documented on the issue.
1. Add appropriate weighting & labels to the issue.
1. Request help/assistance from other parties when the issue requires cross team collaboration.


### Issue Weighting

This is the scale we currently use to add a weighting to issues.

|Size/Weight|Description/Reason|Reference issue|
|---|---|---|
|1 - Trivial| Simple and quick changes.| |
|2 - Small | Straight forward changes, no underlying dependencies needed.||
|3 - Medium | Well understood changes with a few dependencies. Few surprises can be expected. | |
|5 - Large | A task that will require some investigation and research, in addition to the above weights| |
|8 - X-large | A very large task that will require much investigation and research. Pushing Epic level, investigation issues required before breaking the work into small issues ||
|13 - more | Please break the work down further, This would be a quarterly initiative or larger ||


## Performance Indicators

We don't quite know our output for a milestone timeframe, this will take some time to settle down and be predictable.
