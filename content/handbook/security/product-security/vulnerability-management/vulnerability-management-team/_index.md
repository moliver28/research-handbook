This handbook page describes how the Vulnerability Management team works on a day to day, quarter to quarter basis.


## Planning

Currently we do not size work items to fit & align within the quarterly OKR's, we recognise this process is fairly immature and a WIP but satisfied the requirement when it was put in place.

TODO: How will we breakdown quarterly items into appropriately sized issues?
TODO: Will we use a kanban board or similar? (this allows work in progress limits ect)
TODO: Define our planning cadence. [Engineering/secure define this well](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/sec/secure/workflow/#when-engineering-refinement-should-be-completed)
TODO: Define our refinement & sizing cadence.

### Problem validation
The GEO team defines these steps, do we want/need to?

### Solution validation
The GEO team defines these steps, do we want to?

### Refinement & Sizing

The team currently performs adhoc sizing & refinement on work items without a defined weighting scale. We would like to implement a defined weighted scale in the near future to allow a better understanding of team capacity & commitment.

#### Issue Weighting 
This is the scale the team would like to implement.
|Size/Weight|Description/Reason|Reference issue|
|---|---|---|
|1 - Trivial| Simple and quick changes.| |
|2 - Small | Straight forward changes, no underlying dependencies needed.||
|3 - Medium | Well understood changes with a few dependencies. Few surprises can be expected. | |
|5 - Large | A task that will require some investigation and research, in addition to the above weights| |
|8 - X-large | A very large task that will require much investigation and research. Pushing Epic level, investigation issues required before breaking the work into small issues ||
|13 - more | Please break the work down further, This would be a quarterly initiative or larger ||

## Performance Indicators

TODO: What are our performance indicators?
