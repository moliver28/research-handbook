Product security engineers often contribute code to the product. The following list of tools will come handy in doing so.

## GitLab Development Kit (GDK) Installation

Installing a local version of GDK is very practical to allow debugging locally the changes introduced. To view installation instructions visit the GDK repository: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit#installation

### Testing changes locally

Once setup, it is possible to go into the `gitlab` directory where GDK is installed and create a new [`git branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) to start doing modifications and test them on a working GitLab environment.
