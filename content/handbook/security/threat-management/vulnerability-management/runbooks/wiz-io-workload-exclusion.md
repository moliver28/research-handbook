## How to exclude a workload from Wiz.io workload scanning


### Who to contact & where

- Reach out to the Vulnerability Management team via `#g_security_vulnmgmt`.
- Tag `@vulnerability-management` in an open slack channel.


### When would this be required?

An exclusion label/tag can be applied when a workload (Virtual machine, cloud function, RDS ect) has a valid reason to be excluded from workload scanning. Wiz.io will respect the exclusion label & not perform workload scanning against the excluded workload, **the workload is still scanned for misconfigurations**.

>When a workload is excluded:
>
>It is still scanned for misconfigurations.
>Any existing findings generated by the Workload Scanner (e.g., vulnerabilities, secrets) still appear on the Security Graph for 30 days.

### Labels/Tags:

>Both tag keys and tag values are case-sensitive, so WizExclude is different from wizexclude. The former is correct; the latter is wrong (unless in GCP).
>The label/tag's value

- GCP Exclusion label/tag: `{"wizexclude":"this-value-does-not-matter"}`
- AWS Exclusion label/tag: `{"WizExclude":"this-value-does-not-matter"}`


### Who applies the Label/Tag:

As the Vulnerability Management team will not have permission to apply this excluision label, the requesting team will be responsible for applying the exclusion laberl/tag in the most suitable way for the given environment. e.g: Label/Tag applied as part of terraform deployment. the Vulnerability management team will be available to support & advise on this process if required.
