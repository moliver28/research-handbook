title: Security Division Dogfooding Program
---

## Introduction and Purpose

The Security Division plays a critical role in ensuring the security of GitLab as a company, and of GitLab as a platform. In the pursuit of it's charter, the division is committed to using (["dogfooding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)) GitLab as much as possible in order to help improve the platform for all customers.

This dogfooding program aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of collaboration between Product Management and Security as it pertains to capabilities of the GitLab platform.

Historically, dogfooding within the Security Division has not been handled through a formalized program which has likely limited the success of dogfooding efforts.

Historical challenges include:

1. No framework for how feature requests and GitLab inventions and innovations should be prioritized when they come from the Security Division. This has led to some feature requests being indefinitely deferred, and the creation of multiple custom built tools which are used internally, representing functionality GitLab users could otherwise benefit from.
1. No strategic or executive level view for product leadership to understand current adoption, challenges, and desires from the Security Division.
1. Breakage of security processes as a result of bugs, poorly communicated breaking changes, and possibly other causal factors.
1. Limited contributions from Security Division members as a result of not having an assigned learning track for how to effectively contribute quality code to GitLab.

### Desired Outcomes

These outcomes are all within the context of the Security Division.

1. Anyone at GitLab should be able to understand:
    1. How much of the GitLab platform is in use by the division.
    1. Which capabilities are used in their entirety, partially, or not at all by the division.

1. Product Management should be able to understand:
    1. Capabilities which are not used (in part, or in whole) because they don't meet operational requirements for the division
    1. Which feature requests are most important and critical to Security
    1. Which critical security activities rely on specific platform capabilities
    1. How to solicit feedback from any subset of the division with regard to new or updated capabilities

1. Anyone within the Security Division should be able to understand:
    1. How to request a feature enhancement on behalf of the division and how to follow-up on that request.
    1. How to provide effective feedback to Product Management and Product Security Engineering.
    1. How to contribute quality code contributions back to the platform.
    1. Which custom tools are used by the division, and their rationale

1. Dogfood status reporting: Quarterly async updates
1. Critical PM escalations: ?
1. Requests for evaluations from PM to security

## Key Processes

### Management of Security Personas

TBD

### Methodlogy for Dogfooding Assessment

#### Alignment with Product Stages and Information Hierarchy

The organization of the presentation layer of dogfooding data should be done in a way to maximize the efficacy of output. To this end, information will generally presented in alignment with product stages in order to faciliate feedback loops that already mimic the mental models already prevalent across GitLab.

Unless pragmatism dictates otherwise, the ouptut of dogfooding analysis should be organized by product stage.

#### Documenting Capabilities Used, Partially Used, and Unused

Used

1. Current satisfaction
1. Desired improvements

Partials

1. Partial because of limitations
1. Partial because of internal capacity

Unused

1. Due to limitations
1. Lack of awareness
1. Planned, not yet being worked on

### Management of Desired Product Capabilities

1. Feature requests
    1. Creation of user stories
    1. Establishing criticality of need
    1. Relevance to external customers
1. Considerations of build vs buy
    1. Wait for PM
    1. Delegate to product security engineering
    1. Hire contractors to build
    1. Purchase externally

### Management of in-house tooling

TBD

### Management of critical security practices reliant on the GitLab platform

1. Assessments of breaking changes
1. Escalations for critical flaws/bugs introduced

### Evaluating and assessing updated or newly introduced platform capabilities

TBD
