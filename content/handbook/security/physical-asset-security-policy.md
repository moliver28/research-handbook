## Overview

GitLab is an all-remote company and the infrastructure for its SaaS products are hosted and physically secured by third party service providers, GCP & AWS. Physical devices such as laptops are used to manage services provided to customers, and should be secured and used in accordance with this policy. 

Laptops are protected through [Endpoint Management Procedures](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/endpoint-management/) and [IT Security - System Configurations](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/it/security/system-configuration/#clean-deskclear-screen) including but not limited to: passwords, screen timeout, encryption, endpoint detection and response.

To enhance the physical security of devices, especially when working in public places, the following measures should be implemented:
1. Utilize trusted networks when available
- If you are connecting from an untrusted network you should use a VPN connection to avoid MITM Attack or similar.
2. Utilize privacy screen
- Protect your screen with a special film that ensures your privacy. 
3. Keep Clean Desk/Clear Screen
- Devices should be locked when not actively being used.
4. Devices should not be left unattended in public areas.
5. Sensitive data should not be stored on removable storage devices, such as USB drives or external hard drives.
6. Printing documents containing sensitive information is prohibited.
7. Ensure that when you are talking about restricted data you are in a secure place and no-one can hear you.
