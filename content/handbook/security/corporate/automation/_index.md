[CorpSec Helpdesk Slack Issue Automation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/corporate/automation/slack/helpdesk/)
Overview When you ask for help in the #it_help channel, this automation will automatically create a new GitLab issue that creates a long term record of your support request, while providing the ease-of-use of a Slack thread. Each comment in the Slack thread is added to the GitLab issue. This allows us to dogfood GitLab, and also link to related GitLab issues if additional triage is needed or we are cross-linking the audit trail of change management activity, laptop requests, etc.
