## Overview

We use Google Chrome as our primary web browser since many of our collaboration and security tools are natively integrated with Google.

We do not recommend using other browsers such as Firefox, Safari, etc.

## Configuration Steps

- [Vendor Docs - Install Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0#zippy=%2Cmac)
- [Vendor Docs - Chrome Profiles](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277?hl=en&ref_topic=7439538&sjid=3263200837792153330-NC)

## Password Management

Do not allow the Chrome, Safari, or Firefox web browser to save your passwords. Do not use a personal password manager (Bitwarden, LastPass, etc.) or personal 1Password account to store your work credentials. This presents an unnecessary risk.

We use [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business) and the [1Password Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/1password-%E2%80%93-password-mana/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa?hl=en&pli=1) for storing and autofilling all passwords, passkeys, and 2FA One Time Password (OTP) codes.
