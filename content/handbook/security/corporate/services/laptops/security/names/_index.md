title: Laptop Security Standards for Hostnames and Usernames
---

## Overview

You can choose any hostname or username that you wish, including any nerdy names. Our remote management tools and inventory is based on your serial number and hostname, so ensure that your hostname is not NSFW.

## Mac User Account

When you set up your laptop for the first time, your Apple ID will usually configure your display name and user name. If not, you can use any name that you wish. Based on filesystem case sensitivity, it is recommended to keep your username lowercase.

**Username:** It is a best practice to use your `{firstname}` (ex. `kate`) or `{firstInitial}{lastName}` (ex. `klibby`).
**Display Name:** It is best practice to use title case (ex. `Kate Libby`).

## Mac Hostname

When you set up your computer for the first time, your hostname is usually automatically configured with something like `Kate's MacBook Pro`. You can optionally change it to something different (ex. `klibby-m3`) or something fun or nerdy (ex. `acidburn`).

When contacting Corporate Security Helpdesk, you may get asked to confirm the hostname of your computer to ensure that we are helping you with the correct machine in our inventory.
