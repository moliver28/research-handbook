title: Laptop Hostnames and Usernames
---

## Overview

You can choose any hostname or username that you wish. By default the format is `Firstname's MacBook Pro`. For example, John's MacBook Pro, Jane's MacBook Air, etc.

## Mac User Account

When you set up your laptop for the first time, it will ask you to set up the local account. You can use any name that you wish, for the **username** it is a best practice to use your `{firstname}` (ex. `kate`) or `{firstInitial}{lastName}` (ex. `klibby`) and for the **display name** it is best practice to use title case (ex. `Kate Libby`).  Based on filesystem case sensitivity, it is recommended to keep your username lowercase.
