## Overview

Many services that team members use such as Slack and Zoom have mobile applications that can be loaded onto iOS or Android devices, allowing for use of those resources from a mobile phone. Refer to the [acceptable use policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#personal-mobile-phone-and-tablet-usage) for more information on using a mobile device.

Most major applications (Slack, Zoom, Okta Verify) have been examined and vetted by the Security Team, but there are some applications which are not only of limited scope in the data they can access, but also have security issues. In such cases, use the mobile device's web browser for access to the resource. If you have a question about the security of a mobile app and want to know if you should be using it to access GitLab data, review the security tips on [this page](/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/) or contact the Security Team via Slack in the #security channel.
