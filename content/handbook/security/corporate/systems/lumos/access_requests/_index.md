title: Lumos Access Requests
---

## Overview

You can make app access requests using Lumos. Lumos will automatically handle the outreach needed for manager approval, system owner approval, or any other approvals. If the app is capable, Lumos will perform the app provisioning automatically; if the app is incapable, Lumos will reach out to the system owner to perform the provisioning action and will report back when the system owner has confirmed provisioning is complete.

Not all apps will be available in Lumos immediately upon Lumos availaibility at GitLab.  Our catalog of apps will be added to Lumos based on provisioning capability and volume of access requests.

## Making an Access Request

**Note:** Lumos is not yet available for all GitLab Team Members. A launch date and communication will come in the near future.

1. Open Lumos from the Okta tile or in the Slack sidebar
2. Select the app from the list
3. Enter
   - Who the access is for
   - Permission needed
   - Access length
   - Business justification â€” "why" the access is needed
