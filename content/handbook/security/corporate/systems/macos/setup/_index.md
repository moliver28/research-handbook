### Transfer Information from a Mac (Migration Assistant)

If you are a new GitLab team member, choose the `Don't transfer any information now` option. Do not try to transfer information from a personal Mac or your previous company's computer.

If you received a replacement laptop from GitLab, you can choose to transfer information from your old MacBook or start over with a clean slate.

### Siri

**Most team members do not use Siri on their work Mac.** You can always turn it on later if you have a need.

You can use Siri if you'd like. Remember that Siri is tied to your work Apple ID and won't be able to access or control any smart home devices or send messages to your contacts on your personal phone or devices.
