## External Sharing

GitLab Team Members may only share at the permission level of `See only free/busy (hide details)` to recipients who are not also GitLab Team Members. This keeps GitLab data [SAFE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/) because calendars can contain confidential information about GitLab and our customers, as well as attachments.
