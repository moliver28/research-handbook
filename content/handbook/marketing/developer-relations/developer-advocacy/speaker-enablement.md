## Speaker Resources

The Developer Advocate team is always happy to help at any stage of talk preparation, there is also a [speakers resources page](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/speaking-resources/) where you can find helpful guides and tips.

## CFPs

You can learn more about the team's CFP process [here](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/cfps/).

Developer Advocates use Google docs templates for abstracts and biographies, which you can reuse for your own talks.
