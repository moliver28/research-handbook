## <i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mission

To support, grow, and engage the wider [GitLab community](/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines) through collaboration, content, and conversations.

## <i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Strategy

Developer relations and developer advocacy is an evolving, complex field.

Our team focuses on areas aligning with the company's areas of interest including:

- DevSecOps: We want our work to speak to not only developers but all team members involved in the DevSecOps lifecycle to deliver working code to production: Product Managers, software engineers, system and DB administrators, designers, test engineers, security engineers, operations engineers, platform engineers, SREs, development managers and executives, etc.
- Enterprise: Developers and DevSecOps professionals in the enterprise have special constraints and needs.  Often these are glossed over with easy "throw out your architecture and use this new shiny thing" - we won't do that, we'll acknowledge real-world challenges, legacy code, and enterprise constraints and help people solve those problems as well. When applicable, we switch roles into consulting and support.

### KPIs

The [FY25 Marketing Strategy](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/fy25-strategy/#marketing--the-customer-journey) (internal only) shows a Customer Journey with five stages: Awareness, Consideration, Conversion, Expansion, and Evangelism.

While our team can influence people at each stage, our key focus is on Awareness, Consideration, and Evangelism. The KPIs we use to measure our impact on these stages are:

- views from content published across owned and earned channels
- developers engaged through webinars, workshops, and industry events

We also look at Developer Relations influenced pipeline and active community members as performance indicators.

We recognize these KPIs don't capture the impact of the diverse range of work that our team does but understand that tradeoffs can be necessary to effectively communicate our impact within GitLab.

#### OKRs

- [OKR list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues?first_page_size=20&label_name%5B%5D=developer-advocacy&sort=updated_desc&state=opened&type%5B%5D=objective)

### What fits in our strategy

When we are reviewing opportunities or requests for support, we must be able to answer yes to each of these questions to move forward with the work:

1. Will this work support, grow, and/or engage the GitLab community, i.e. end-users, prospects and customers?
1. Is there a measurable impact against one of our team's KPIs? Because of GitLab's [global optimization subvalue](/handbook/values/#global-optimization), we'll also consider requests that influence a company KPI or contribute to progress on an OKR.
1. Has an issue been created to define the work and assign a DRI?

If the answer to any of the above questions is "no", we ask the requestor to take one of the following actions:

1. make adjustments so we can take on the work
1. find another team that is better suited to deliver the work
1. come to an agreement that the work should not be done

## <i class="fa fa-tasks" aria-hidden="true"></i> What we do

Our developer advocate team can be summarized by the "Three Cs":

1. **Content creation:** This is what many often think of when thinking of the traditional role of developer relations: writing blog posts, delivering technical talks, participating in podcasts or panels, and sharing ideas and thoughts on social media. Content creation also includes assets co-created with other GitLab teams, inside and outside of Marketing.
1. **Community engagement:** Our team regularly engages with the wider GitLab community when they have questions, concerns, and feedback. This typically happens on GitLab issues, the GitLab Forum, Hacker News, Twitter, Stack Overflow, and other social media sites but also happens during in-person and virtual events.
1. **Consulting:** Within GitLab, our team represents the voice of the community. When other teams are working on changes or decisions that will impact the community, we will educate them on our community, advocate for community interests, and work to ensure that any potential impacts to the community are clearly understood and addressed when communicating such changes. Our team also shares our knowledge of industry trends, emerging tools, social media strategy, and other skills to support our teammates in achieving their goals in alignment with GitLab's [Global Optimization](/handbook/values/#global-optimization) subvalue.

### Social media

We build our thought leadership on social media. See [Developer Advocacy on Social Media](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/) to learn more about our strategies and become an evangelist yourself.

### Content creation

We build out content to help educate developers around best practices related to DevOps, GitLab, remote work, and other topics where we have expertise. Content includes presentations, demos, workshops, blog posts, and media engagements. Content creation also includes assets co-created with other GitLab teams, inside and outside of Marketing.

Please read the [Content](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content) handbook to learn more about the content workflow, library and distribution with UTM tracking.

### Working with agencies

Sometimes, the Developer Advocate team works with external agencies, e.g. video production, translations, white paper production, competitive analyses, etc. In these cases, there will typically be some budget already allocated for this type of work. One of the agencies that we use for video production is [PieHole.tv](https://piehole.tv/). Once, you have a technical video in mind that you'd like to them produce, follow these steps:

#### Develop the video script

Make a copy of the following [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J82jCFhk1k0kW35nPkcbzWH6zyxLktwvPgrvmXcmugo/edit?usp=sharing) to start developing the script for the video and place the copy in your Google drive.

#### Create an issue for the video

Head to this [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/partners/piehole.tv/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&first_page_size=100), and create a new issue.


For the issue title, enter a string that follows this syntax: "PieHole demo - [ENTER THE NATURE OF YOUR VIDEO]", e.g. "PieHole demo - GitLab Duo Chat".

In the description of the issue, include a link to the script document that you created in the previous section in the form of "Original script: [Link to Google doc]".

Assign yourself to the issue and in a comment of the issue tag the following people:

- PieHole.tv members: @yvette4, @dinette
- Our Brand video team: @joanna_c, @dharper-ext
- Any stakeholders from other GitLab teams, whose involvement you deem necessary

#### Develop the script

Start developing the script in the Google doc you created above. Technical videos should ideally be less than 2 minutes in duration. However, for longer videos, they should be no longer than ten minutes. Videos that are 10-min long or less can be published in our [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg). Videos that are longer than 10 minutes are published to our [Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A).

As you develop the script, we recommend that you follow this sequence:

- State the problem/pain that the capability(ies) presented in the video will solve
- Introduce the capability(ies) that you will show in the video
- Show the product demo portion that demonstrates how the capability(ies) solve the problem/pain. As you present the capabilities, mention the benefits of each.
- State the overall benefits of the capability(ies) presented in the video

#### Record the raw product demo

Perform a screen recording that shows the product capabilities that solve the problem/pain that the script talks about. You can use screen recording software, such as, QuickTime, Adobe Premiere, or Camtasia to record the raw product demo on your Mac.

Save the recording as a 4K or 1080p MP4 or a MOV file and upload it to your Google drive.

As you develop the script scenes, indicate the timestamp in the raw recording for the specific scene in the SKETCH column of the scene rows.

Update the issue you created earlier, by adding to it the link to your uploaded raw product demo video in the form of "Raw MP4: [Link to the MP4 in your Google drive]".

#### Have the script reviewed

Once you have your first draft of the script finished, have it reviewed by the appropriate stakeholders. For our team, a good person to have it reviewed is @johncoghlan. Others can include members of our Brand video team and appropriate Product Marketing Managers (PMMs).

#### Attend our weekly calls with PieHole.tv

Start attending our weekly calls with PieHole.tv. They take place on Thursdays at 12 noon EDT/EST US. Please reach out to @yvette4 from PieHole.tv to be added to the calls. These weekly calls serve as a sync point for all work presently being done asynchronously.

#### Add link to PieHole.tv-managed script to the issue

Once the script has been reviewed by all appropriate GitLab team members that you deemed necessary, you need to let PieHole.tv know so that they can take ownership of the file contents. At this point, they will make a copy of the script file and will own it from this point until the completion of the video production.

At this point, PieHole will update the issue by adding in the first line of the issue Description the following: "Script managed by PieHole.tv: [Link to the script file managed by PieHole.tv]". If you don't see this happening, remind PieHole.tv about this or request the link from them and add this line at the top of the issue description.

The whole production process for a video should take about 5 weeks if there are no delays on our part.

#### Publish tech video at the following locations

Once the video is finished and finalized by PieHole.tv, they will provide the link to the HD MP4 file to it. Download the file to your Mac and then upload it to the following locations:

- Our [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg) if the video is 1-min long or less. If there is a specific playlist that the video needs to be added to, this is when you would do that too.
- Our [Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) if the video is longer than 10 minutes.
- Our [Vimeo directory](https://vimeo.com/user/115027220/folder/17153021?isPrivate=false) for Developer Relations videos. Upload it so that it's "hidden but can be embedded".
- Our [Team Highspot spot](https://gitlab.highspot.com/spots/66e34f47b2ec5ee197c6ad90).

#### Announce on our slack channels

Post a brief slack message on the following slack channels announcing the availability of the new video:

- dev-advocacy-team
- developer-relations
- marketing
- product-marketing
- whats-happening-at-gitlab

#### Post on your social media channels

Announce the availability of the video in your own social channels and make sure to tag GitLab in the announcement. We typically announce on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

#### Move or copy files to Developer Advocacy drive

In the [PieHole.tv directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vlDSx4JdtXl4e2lLYC8sgbeHZ2MSZpdU), create a sub-directory with a name that describes the final video, e.g. "GitLab Duo Chat". In this newly created sub-directory, copy or move the following files related to the specific video:

- A copy of the final script managed by PieHole.tv
- The raw product demo you recorded you recorded in MP4 or MOV format
- The final HD MP4 delivered by PieHole.tv

Also ensure that our Brand team gets a copy of the project files for specific video from PieHole.tv

That's it!

### Corporate event support

The Developer Advocate team plays a key role in supporting events. We work closely alongside [Corporate Event Marketing](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/corporate-events/) to provide strategic content and assistance for both corporate and third-party sponsored events. This collaboration ensures the success and seamless execution of various gatherings. To learn more please refer to the [Events page](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/events/).

### Consultancy

Developer Advocates serve as consultants and subject matter experts (SMEs), leveraging their expertise and experience to support teams and customers with product features, new SKUs, and other topics.

Please read the [Consultancy](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/consultancy/) handbook to learn more about consultancy requests, decision matrix, and examples with GitLab Duo / AI adoption.

### Spokespersons

Developer Advocates are subject matter experts (SMEs) in their focus areas, and collaborate with the [Corporate Communications team](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/) to provide media coverage in the form of interviews, podcasts, content by-lines, etc. Developer Advocates are [GitLab spokespersons](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/#spokesperson-criteria) and are required to take relevant training as determined by the [Corporate Communications team](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/).

### Community Engagement

Our team regularly engages with the wider GitLab community. We do this organically on social media when prompted by our social media team or other GitLab team members and by [monitoring GitLab and other selected keywords on Hacker News](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/hacker-news/). We also manage a few social media platforms ourselves.

The Developer Advocate team is the DRI for questions and strategy on the platforms below:
