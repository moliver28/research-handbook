## <i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mission

To support, grow, and engage the GitLab community, i.e. end-users, prospects and customers, through collaboration, content, and conversations.

## <i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Strategy
Developer relations and developer advocacy is an evolving, complex field.

Our team focuses on areas aligning with the company's areas of interest including:
* DevSecOps: We want our work to speak to not only developers but all team members involved in the DevSecOps lifecycle to deliver working code to production: Product Managers, software engineers, system and DB administrators, designers, test engineers, security engineers, operations engineers, platform engineers, SREs, development managers and executives, etc.
* Enterprise: Developers and DevSecOps professionals in the enterprise have special constraints and needs.  Often these are glossed over with easy “throw out your architecture and use this new shiny thing” - we won’t do that, we’ll acknowledge real-world challenges, legacy code, and enterprise constraints and help people solve those problems as well. When applicable, we switch roles into consulting and support.

### KPIs

The [FY25 Marketing Strategy](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/fy25-strategy/#marketing--the-customer-journey) (internal only) shows a Customer Journey with five stages: Awareness, Consideration, Conversion, Expansion, and Evangelism.

We impact each level of the funnel through the content we create, the events we support, and the other activities that help us reach more developers. The KPIs we use to measure our impact on these two stages are:
- views from content published across owned and earned channels
- developers engaged through webinars, workshops, and industry events

We recognize these KPIs don't capture the impact of the diverse range of work that our team does but understand that tradeoffs can be necessary to effectively communicate our impact within GitLab.

#### OKRs

- [OKR list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues?first_page_size=20&label_name%5B%5D=developer-advocacy&sort=updated_desc&state=opened&type%5B%5D=objective)

### What fits in our strategy

When we are reviewing opportunities or requests for support, we must be able to answer yes to each of these questions to move forward with the work:
1. Will this work support, grow, and/or engage the GitLab community, i.e. end-users, prospects and customers?
1. Is there a measurable impact against one of our team's KPIs? Because of GitLab's [global optimization subvalue](/handbook/values/#global-optimization), we'll also consider requests that influence a company KPI or contribute to progress on an OKR.
1. Has an issue been created to define the work and assign a DRI?

If the answer to any of the above questions is "no", we ask the requestor to take one of the following actions:
1. make adjustments so we can take on the work
1. find another team that is better suited to deliver the work
1. come to an agreement that the work should not be done

### Stable counterparts

Inspired by GitLab's [collaboration value](/handbook/values/#collaboration), the Developer Advocate team has chosen to align ourselves as [stable counterparts](/handbook/leadership/#stable-counterparts) with divisions outside of Marketing. The alignment is as follows:

| Division  | Stable counterpart | Activities |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|
| Alliances & Infrastructure | [Abubakar Siddiq Ango](https://gitlab.com/abuango) | [Infrastructure Meetings](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/#meetings), [Alliances](/handbook/alliances/) |

## <i class="fa fa-tasks" aria-hidden="true"></i> What we do


Our developer advocate team can be summarized by the "Three Cs":

1. **Content creation:** This is what many often think of when thinking of the traditional role of developer relations: writing blog posts, delivering technical talks, participating in podcasts or panels, and sharing ideas and thoughts on social media. Content creation also includes assets co-created with other GitLab teams, inside and outside of Marketing.
1. **Community engagement:** Our team regularly engages with the wider GitLab community when they have questions, concerns, and feedback. This typically happens on GitLab issues, the GitLab Forum, Hacker News, Twitter, Stack Overflow, and other social media sites but also happens during in-person and virtual events.
1. **Consulting:** Within GitLab, our team represents the voice of the community. When other teams are working on changes or decisions that will impact the community, we will educate them on our community, advocate for community interests, and work to ensure that any potential impacts to the community are clearly understood and addressed when communicating such changes. Our team also shares our knowledge of industry trends, emerging tools, social media strategy, and other skills to support our teammates in achieving their goals in alignment with GitLab's [Global Optimization](/handbook/values/#global-optimization) subvalue.

### Social media

We build our thought leadership on social media. See [Developer Advocacy on Social Media](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/) to learn more about our strategies and become an evangelist yourself.

### Content creation

We build out content to help educate developers around best practices related to DevOps, GitLab, remote work, and other topics where we have expertise. Content includes presentations, demos, workshops, blog posts, and media engagements. Content creation also includes assets co-created with other GitLab teams, inside and outside of Marketing.

Please read the [Content](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content) handbook to learn more about the content workflow, library and distribution with UTM tracking.

### Corporate event support

The Developer Advocate team plays a key role in supporting events. We work closely alongside [Corporate Event Marketing](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/corporate-events/) to provide strategic content and assistance for both corporate and third-party sponsored events. This collaboration ensures the success and seamless execution of various gatherings. To learn more please refer to the [Events page](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/events/).

### Spokespersons

Developer Advocates are subject matter experts (SMEs) in their focus areas, and collaborate with the [Corporate Communications team](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/) to provide media coverage in the form of interviews, podcasts, content by-lines, etc. Developer Advocates are [GitLab spokespersons](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/#spokesperson-criteria) and are required to take relevant training as determined by the [Corporate Communications team](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/).

### Community Engagement

Our team regularly engages with the wider GitLab community. We do this organically on social media when prompted by our social media team or other GitLab team members and by [monitoring GitLab and other selected keywords on Hacker News](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/hacker-news/). We also manage a few social media platforms ourselves.

The Developer Advocate team is the DRI for questions and strategy on the platforms below:

#### Community Engagement Initiatives

The Developer Advocate team is dedicated to building, supporting, and retaining a strong and engaged community through initiatives, including newsletters, mentoring, badges, and sharing resources.

##### Community Response

Given the Developer Advocate team's understanding of our community and broad knowledge of GitLab, we regularly engage in the response of situations that require intervention to address urgent and important concerns of our community members. We have a documented process for how we [manage these situations](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/community-response/).

##### Community Newsletter

We run a monthly [Community Newsletter](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/community-newsletter) dedicated to sharing relevant developer content, highlighting contribution opportunities, and updating community members on upcoming events. We aim to keep our contributors involved and connected with the wider community.

##### Mentoring and Coaching

We make our practices and processes publicly available to foster a diverse and inclusive community. We also offer [mentor and coaching](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/mentoring-coaching/) opportunities to share our expertise, encourage professional growth, and promote a welcoming environment.

### Release Evangelism

Developer Advocates should always be prepared to promote our [monthly release](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#release-evangelism) and engage in [community response on release days](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/hacker-news/#release-days) given the historical performance of release posts on Hacker News.

### Tools

Our team uses different tools to grow and analyze our thought leadership, automate workflows, and improve written and presentation skills. See [Developer Advocate Tools](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/tools/) for a list of all of those tools.

### Projects

Our team maintains many projects to help show off technical concepts, engage with communities, provide examples of using GitLab with other technologies, and automate our team processes. See [Developer Advocate Projects](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/projects/) for a list of all of those projects.

### OSS Contributions

We actively contribute to OSS projects and share our technical expertise. You can learn more about our ideas and visions in our [OSS contributions](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/oss-contributions/) handbook page.


### Content Effectiveness

Measuring what we do is very important to understand our impact, re-assess content strategies, and reach our OKR goals. Learn more in [Developer Relations Content Effectiveness](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/content-effectiveness/).
