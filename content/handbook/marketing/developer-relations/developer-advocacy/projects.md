## Introduction

We maintain our projects in the public [gitlab-da group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da). This group has access to an Ultimate subscription.

The group organizes use cases, workshops, tutorials, maintained [open source projects](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/oss-contributions/), demo playgrounds, thought leadership research, and more learning resources.

## Organisation Structure

All projects are organized in sub-groups on the top level. No projects are allowed on the top-level namespace `gitlab.com/gitlab-da`.

### Access

Access is limited to [team members in the `gitlab-da` group](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-da/-/group_members). Adding/removing members [requires an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues) to document the change.

Allowed exceptions are workshop sub-groups that invite external users into their workshop projects temporarily. All temporarily added users [**must** use a membership expiration date of 7 days](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#add-users-to-a-project).

### Add a new project or group

1. Define the scope of your project, and add it into one of the top-level groups.
1. When unsure, create the project in the [playground](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/playground) group first, and transfer it to its production location later in the project settings.

**Do not create new top-level groups without first proposing the change in an issue/MR.**

#### README

Always add a `README.md` file that explains the purpose of the project/group (copy the text into `Settings > General > Description`), and links all resources (issues, direction pages, blog posts, etc.). GitLab supports [Group READMEs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/manage#add-group-readme) next to project READMEs.

Optional but recommended: Add a project/group avatar image that illustrates the topic. Use an official GitLab brand image, or download [a free asset from Unsplash](/handbook/legal/ip-public-materials-guidelines/#visual-content-including-videos-gifs-photographs-illustrations-graphics-and-artwork). Add the credits to the `README.md` file.

Tip: You can [resize images](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#resizing-images) using the following CLI command:

```
find . -type f -exec sh -c 'convert {} -resize 150 {}' \;
```

#### Group: Use Cases

1. Blog posts or thought leadership research usually describe a use case or specific topic. Review the existing [use-cases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases), add a new project or sub-group.
1. If your use case is new, create a new subgroup, add a description, and update the handbook organization structure. Add yourself as DRI to the table.

#### Group: Tutorials and Workshops

1. [Tutorials](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/tutorials) provide helpful content to learn specific topics and have a DRI assigned to maintain the projects. Tutorials are referenced in blog posts, webinars, etc.
1. [Workshops](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/workshops) provide self-contained learning resources in the form of exercises, solutions, etc. in a single repository.

When unsure where to start, create a new tutorial sub group first, and later decide to migrate the content to a workshop for example.

#### Group: Projects

The [projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/projects) group contains all projects that are used in production. They require extended documentation in the team handbook, since the team depends on the functionality for workflows and efficiency. We also maintain microsites that are served with GitLab Pages and custom domains.

### Remove a project/group

Our demo projects are referenced in blog posts and other public content. Moving these projects/groups into the [unmaintained](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/unmaintained) is recommended to signal their deprecation to users instead of archiving/deleting the projects.

## Project Resources

Some projects require access to Kubernetes clusters, self-managed CI/CD Runners, cloud VMs, domains, etc. The team has access to Google Cloud or AWS cloud resources that allow hosting these types of external infrastructure dependencies for GitLab.com SaaS demos.

### Workflow

1. Document the project setup in its README file (or a in a docs/ structure in the Git repository).
1. Shutdown resources when not needed (i.e. Kubernetes clusters).
1. Always add [security scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/) as default, unless it competes with the demo cases.

For demos that require debugging the deployments, prefer shared resources, for example in Google Cloud.

1. Document access in the 1Password vault if not available via SSO login.
1. A GitLab app requires oauth setup from an account. Use a group shared account (e.g. DE Bot) for production apps (Code challenge, etc.)

Shared cloud resources examples:

1. All team members can manage resources in Google Cloud in the [community-group project](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview?hl=en&project=group-community-a29572) and `Editor` role. Create an [access request](/handbook/business-technology/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/) to add/remote team members.
1. Google Cloud/AWS also allows you to [register domains that are not trademarked](/handbook/it/guides/domains-dns/#non-trademark-domain-names) (no `gitlab` in the name!) and use the domains for demo setups.

For individual short-lived tutorials or demo setups for a blog post, prefer the [Cloud Sandbox Realm](/handbook/infrastructure-standards/realms/sandbox/#how-to-get-started). This provides automated shutdown, generated domains for easier access, etc.

```

### Remote Development Workspaces

The [remote-development sub group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/remote-development) has an agent for Kubernetes installed, which is documented in the [agent-kubernetes-gke](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/remote-development/agent-kubernetes-gke) project. This includes troubleshooting when the agent becomes unresponsive, and workspaces are not created.

Assigned resources:

1. The Kubernetes cluster [`de-remote-development-1`](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview?project=group-community-a29572) is running in GKE. Current resources: 3 nodes. Total 6 vCPU, 12 GB memory.
1. The domain `remote-dev.dev` has been purchased through the Google DNS service and points to the Kubernetes cluster's public IP.
1. The TLS certificates have been generated manually with Let's Encrypt and need to be renewed quarterly (2023-08-15), following the [documentation steps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/remote-development/agent-kubernetes-gke).

### Thought Leadership: Observability

#### Kubernetes Observability workshop for Kube Simplify

Published: 2022.

Michael Friedrich provides a 3.5 hours live workshop on Kubernetes Observability for the [Kube Simplify workshop series](https://kubesimplify.github.io/live-workshops/) as a free learning resource. After an introduction, the workshop starts with an overview of monitoring, metrics with Prometheus, and how to build and use dashboards in Kubernetes. Alerts, incidents and SLOs are practiced by example, building the bridge into more Observability data with tracing, logs and more event types. Chaos engineering is practiced with Chaos Mesh to trigger alerts when DNS errors force an app to leak memory. This allows users to practice the [KubeCon EU 2022 demo](https://youtu.be/BkREMg8adaI) themselves. Scaling, long term storage, security workflows as well as new innovative ideas with OpenTelemetry and eBPF are discussed too. The workshop includes exercises and solutions ready for production environments afterwards.

## EveryoneCanContribute cafe

Maintainer: [Michael Friedrich](/handbook/company/team/#dnsmichi)

[everyonecancontribute.com](https://everyonecancontribute.com) serves as the main website for a community formed around tech coffee chats called `#EveryoneCanContribute cafe` (active) and `#EveryoneCanContribute Kaeffchen` (retired).

The coffee chats are organized as [meetup.com group events](https://www.meetup.com/everyonecancontribute-cafe/) and are open for topic or theme suggestions from everyone.

* Try out newly announced projects together.
* Do pair programming/debugging sessions.
* Start discussions and share ideas on the latest technology.

The sessions are hosted by Michael Friedrich. Developer Advocate team members are assigned as alternative hosts in Zoom. The meetups are hosted in Zoom with a waiting room as default, the Zoom URL is hidden in the meetup group event. team members can access the URL in the [Developer Advocate team calendar](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/). For joining the group, users need a profile picture and provide their name for joining an event. This is to protect against Zoom bombing and otherwise harmful intentions.

Next to Zoom, everyone can hangout with text or audio in [Discord](https://everyonecancontribute.com/page/handbook/#discord).

The website's [About page](https://everyonecancontribute.com//page/about/) covers more details including the exact date and time.

Insights:

* The website is built using [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/).
* Organization happens in the GitLab group [everyonecancontribute](https://gitlab.com/groups/everyonecancontribute/-/issues). This group has applied for an Ultimate license for OSS projects.
