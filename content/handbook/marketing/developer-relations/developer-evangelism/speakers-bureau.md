## What is the Speakers Bureau?    

The Speakers Bureau is a group of GitLab team members and members of the wider GitLab community who are available to participate in events and deliver talks about GitLab, CI/CD, open source, remote work, and other topics. 

## Find a speaker  

A list of speakers bureau members can be found on our [Speakers Bureau page](/speakers/). After identifying a speaker for an event or other speaking opportunity, please [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/new?issuable_template=speaker-request) to request the speaker. 

## Join the Speakers Bureau

If you would like to join the speakers bureau, we ask that you submit an MR to add yourself to the [Speakers Bureau page](/speakers/). This can be done by adding the following lines to the speakers.yml file in the www-gitlab-com project.

To create an MR for the Speakers Bureau page, you will need:

- Your personal Twitter / GitLab handles
- Links to recent (in the last 12 months) relevant presentations or talks you have delivered
- If you are not a GitLab team member, please include a link to video of a recent presentation.

Once you have the above items, follow these steps to add yourself to create your MR:

1. Go to the [speakers.yml file in the GitLab.com / www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/speakers.yml) project.
1. On the file page, click on the button labeled `Web IDE` near the middle of the page.
1. For community members: if prompted, click `Fork` to create a Fork of the repo which will allow you to make changes and submit a Merge Request.
1. You should see the `speakers.yml` file open in your browser. 
1. Copy and paste the entry below and enter your information into each of the blank fields. Remove the commented lines (starting with `#`) when not used.

### Linting
When adding yourself to the Speakers Bureau, you may get a linting error in the build.  If that happens, ensure that the following requirements are met:

* Unique `name`: Your name must be unique - if you have the same name as another speaker add your middle inital or other identifiers 
* Unique `gitlab`: You must put your unique GitLab.com username in this field
* Unique `twitter`: You must put your unique Twitter username in this field
* Headshot: You must place your headshot in the `source/images/speakers` and reference it just by file name in the `picture` field.
* Valid `region`: Make sure your `region` field is one the allowed regions.  See [speakers_requirements.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/speakers_requirements.yml#L1) for a list of the allowed regions.
* Valid `topics`:  Make sure your `topics` field only contains allowed topics.  See [speakers_requirements.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/speakers_requirements.yml#L10) for a list of the allowed topics.

> To find the linters in the `www-gitlab-com` repository, search for the `lint:speakers_yml` namespace.
