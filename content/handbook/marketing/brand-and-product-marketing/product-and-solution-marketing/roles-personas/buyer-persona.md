title: "Buyer Personas"

### Buyer personas

Buyer personas represent the people who serve as the main buyers in an organization or
the champions within an enterprise that drive the buying conversation and
coordinate various teams to make a purchase. We've updated our approach to include persona groups, in addition to specific roles or titles within a group, based on the Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework.

![IT Orgchart](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/images/buyerpersonaorgchart-2022-09-29.png)

1. [CIO](#tech-exec-tristan)
2. [App Dev](#app-dev-avery)
2. [Security](#infosec-shiloh)
3. [Platform](#platform-perry)
4. [Compliance](#compliance-cooper)
5. [Release](#release-rory)
7. [PMO](#program-management-payton)
8. [Back Office](#back-office-blake)

Also see [the three tiers on our pricing page](/handbook/company/pricing/#three-tiers).

#### Enterprise IT roles we sell to

While personas describe ideal targets, roles are the real people in job titles you will encounter while selling. Understanding the challenges faced by each role, along with what they care most about, is helpful to deliver the right value proposition to the right person. It will help you know:
a) if they are even someone who may have an interest in GitLab (don't waste time),
b) what questions to ask to learn more and qualify the lead,
c) what value prop they'll want to hear that could get them to a demo, discussion, or POC.

See the [Enterprise IT Roles page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/enterprise-it-roles/) for more details about who we sell to and how to approach them.

#### Writing for all personas

- When writing content, always remember to use the [GitLab voice](https://design.gitlab.com/brand/overview/#tone-of-voice) regardless of the persona.
- Never alienate other personas. You can appeal to a buyer without buzzword bingo.
- Look at who uses a channel most (twitter & docs: user, webinar linkedin: buyer) when shared (website) guide them /features for users /solutions for buyers.

#### Overall recommendations

- Develop content and build ‘persona-lized’ buyer’s journeys for more efficient targeting
- Rethink messaging to leverage most effective drivers by persona
- Consider alternative content sites (Reddit, Quora, Medium) to target specific personas
- Help champions sell their ideas internally with the resources they say they need (ROI / case studies / real world benefits / hard data / Proof of Concepts)
- Explore opportunities to provide tech education / ‘mentoring’ to personas with less than 10 years experience (due to lack of mid-level personnel peers / mentors and 16+ years set aging out)
- Note: Although IC developers are no longer driving our growth KPIs, they ARE heavy influencers on buyers—their product adoption and evangelism is critical to expansion and renewals
