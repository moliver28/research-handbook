## Sales Development Inbound Process

This page is part of the Sales Development team's handbook [page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/) and aims to break our inbound lead management process into small how-to sections.

While the contents below are meant to get you up to speed quickly, we also have a wealth of resources for team members that are looking to perfect their craft [here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development-knowledge-base/).


## Where to find your leads

Inbound leads get automatically imported to SFDC by the Sales Operations team, you can find links to their handbook pages on our [main page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development). 

To find and access your leads, please navigate to SFDC's homepage and click on the `Leads` tab. You will find the lead views below. These views are split per use-case for your convenience. The KPIs for managing these leads are thoroughly outlined in our [SLAs page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/roe-kpis-slas). 

### SDR Lead Views

| View   | Description                                                                                                        |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S1 - High Priority View | These are leads that are marked as High Priority because of some high Propensity To Purchase indication. |
| S1 View | These are your net new leads that have scored high enough to reach MQL status.                                            |
| S2 View | This is a view of your existing leads that also have an associated phone call so you can easily reference your callable pipeline. |
| S3 View | Qualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls. Each lead needs to either be active in a follow-up sequence, have an active task, or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date. |

### Lead and Database Management

As part of your SDR responsibilities, you are expected to perform due diligence on each lead you receive. This includes checking the database for duplicate records, as well as referencing against our [RoE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/roe-kpis-slas).
