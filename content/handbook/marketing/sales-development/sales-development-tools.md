# Sales Development Tools

This page is to act as your guide to the many tools and best practices that the Sales Development Organization uitlizes.

## Salesforce

[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) is our CRM of record. It integrates with all of the other applications in our business tech stack. Salesforce stores prospect, customer, and partner information. This includes contact information, products purchased, bookings, support tickets, and invoices, among other information.

### Salesforce Training Resources



### Lead and Contact Views

#### SDR Lead Views

* **S1 View** - [MQL’s](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#mql-and-lead-scoring) and Hot leads that require quick follow up (i.e event)s, and Drift conversation leads for tenured SDRs
* **S2 View** - Only leads that are active in a HT touch sequence and have a phone number
* **S3 View** - Qualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls.  Each lead needs to either be active in a follow-up sequence, have an active task, or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date.

#### BDR Lead Views

* **B1 View** - [MQL’s](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#mql-and-lead-scoring) and Hot leads that require quick follow up 
* **B2 View** - Leads associated with “Actively Working” accounts where you are the BDR Assigned
* **B3 View** - Needs to be sequenced. They’re leads you chose to move into your name but they have not yet been sequenced
* **B4 View** - Active HT sequenced leads that have a phone number - to help with call downs
* **B5 View** - Qualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls. Each lead needs to either be active in a follow up sequence, have an active task or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date


#### BDR Contact Views

**Contact ownership is based on the BDR Assigned and Account owner fields. If you are the BDR Assigned on the account, you will be the owner of all contacts associated with that account. If there is no BDR Assigned, the account owner will be the owner of the contacts.**

* **B1 View** - Includes MQL’s, Hot contacts that require quick follow up 
* **B2 View** - Contacts related to Actively working accounts that you can choose to sequence - *give 48 hrs
* **B3 View** - Active HT sequenced leads that have a phone number - to help with call downs
* **B4 View** - Qualifying leads. Contacts that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either on email or through phone calls. Each contact in this status needs to either be active in a follow up sequence, have an active task or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date.

## Outreach

[Outreach.io](https://www.outreach.io/) is a tool used to automate emails in the form of sequences. Users can track open rates, click-through rates, response rates for various templates, and update sequences based on these metrics. Outreach.io also helps to track sales activities such as calls. All emails/calls/tasks that are made through Outreach.io are automatically logged in Salesforce with a corresponding disposition. See below for a list of current call dispositions, what they mean, and scenarios on when to use each of them.

### Outreach Training Resources

* [Intro Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IpTVE4-Nkblfuiu6f1OUnFbi8IpjRPK7UDSx4eSfQCg/edit#slide=id.g5a343b482a_2_10) and [Training Video](https://gitlab.edcast.com/journey/weeks/cards/7257647)

* GitLab Edcast: [Advanced Outreach Training](https://gitlab.edcast.com/journey/weeks)
* Best Practices: [Our Outreach Handbook Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/)

### Outreach Sequences

 A user created series of touchpoints (calls, emails, LinkedIn) in order to communicate with a prospect and automate the user's workflow

* **Primary Sequence:** a sequence created by SDR leadership that should be used by all reps to follow up with inbound leads
* High touch and low touch sequences: a high touch sequence should be used for higher-quality leads. High touch sequences require you to add in more personalization and have more touch points across a longer period of time, including phone calls and LinkedIn Connect requests. Low touch sequences are typically automated and run for a shorter period of time. We define higher quality leads based on the volume of inbound you have to manage as well as whether the lead has has 1-2 of the following for MM/Large accounts:
    * Valid company email domain or company name
    * Phone number
    * Title related to our buying/influencer personas
    * 6Sense intent
    * Set up for company/team use checkbox equals true
    * Account has X # of Developers (MM/Large nuances)
    * LinkedIn profile
        * SMB lead may need to have 2-3 of the above1-2 of the above
        * Different teams may have nuances so please check in with your manager for their feedback.

### Outreach Collections

Ways to organize similar sequences and snippets

* **Common Collections**
    * [FY24 Global Inbound High Touch Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2269%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc)
    * [FY24 Global Inbound Low Touch Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2271%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc)
    * [FY24 Inbound Languages Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2270%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc) 
    * [Events Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2266%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc)

### Outreach Tags

A method of distinguishing sequences and snippets from others. Use tags to help narrow down which sequences you should be using in a particular situation

#### Common Tag Examples:

* **Primary-** a sequence created by SDR leadership that should be used by all reps to follow up with inbound leads
* **High Touch/Low Touch-** Distinguish if the sequence is high or low touch
* **Region-** Can be used to show which region the sequence 
* **GTM-** The message trying to be delivered. Ex. Security, CI/CD ect. 
* **Inbound/Outbound-** Whether the sequence is meant for inbound or outbound prospecting 
* **Language-** What language the sequence is written in

### Outreach Snippets

Content created for BDRS and SDRs to use to create hyper-personalized sequences, one-off emails, or to use for reaching out to prospects via LinkedIn.

* **Common Snippet Examples**
     - [Objection Snippets](https://app1a.outreach.io/snippets?direction=asc&order=owner&tags%5B%5D=objection)
     - [Support Snippets](https://app1a.outreach.io/snippets?direction=asc&order=owner&tags%5B%5D=Support)

### Outreach Sequence Creation Process

#### Prior to Building a New Sequence

Please review the BDR or SDR process and conceptualize what iteration does a new sequence bring to our existing library, from the moment you have clarified your intent please [follow the steps here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#new-outreach-sequenceworkflow-creation) to request a new sequence, we'll work with you to develop the best possible iteration we can. 

#### Building a New Sequence, Prior to Setting it Live
As you begin building your new sequence, make sure you are following the proper guidelines:

* **Naming Convention** - all sequences should use the approved naming convention: 
    -   **Year** (FY24) 
    -   **Team** (IB) 
    -   **Region** (Worldwide - WW, AMER, APAC, EMEA, LATAM)
    -   **Segment** (SMB SDR, LARGE MM SDR) 
    -   **Target/Reason for Sequence** (Trial, Contact Request, Event, etc)
    -   **Touch Level** (High Touch - HT, Low Touch - LT)
    -   **Language** (English - EN, Spanish - SP, Portuguese - POR, French - FR, German - GER, Dutch - DUT, Russian - RUS, Korean - KOR, Japanese - JP)

**Example** - FY24 IB WW SMB SDR Free to Paid HT EN

* **Sequence Settings**:
    - **Sequence Type** - Steps by day interval
	- **Delivery Schedule** - Weekday Business Hours
	- **Interval Type** - Schedule Days
	- **Tags** - always add “SDR” or "BDR" and “Inbound” or "Outbound" along with any other applicable tags such as the Region, Team, and Touch Level
	- **Collections** - choose the appropriate collection based on team and purpose
	- **Shared with Org?** - Others can see it and use it
	- **When the primary prospect replies** - Finish sequence
	- **When non-primary prospects reply** - Finish sequence
	- **Prospect Throttling** - Enabled
	- **Max active prospects per user** - 1000
	- **Auto-activate prospects** - Yes - activate based on throttles
	- **Max adds per user every 24 hours** - 100
	- **Sequence Ruleset**: 
        - **Default** - Does not make tasks on your behalf. Prospects can be added to these sequences more than once, if not already active. prospects are not able to be added to other exclusive sequences, but can be added to a non-exclusive sequence. Updates prospects to appropriate stages. Resumes out of office prospects after 5 days.
        - **Campaign** - Follows the same rules as the default settings except out of office are resumed 1 day after.
        - **Create Call Task** - Follows same rules as the default except it will create call tasks on opened emails. Minimum email opens needed: 2
        - **Event** - Prospects can only be added to this sequence once. They are not exclusive to this sequence. Out of office are resumed 1 day after.
        - **Follow Up Sequences** - This ruleset is specifically designed for prospects who are already in qualifying stage as once you add them, their lead status will stay in qualifying rather than going back to accepted.
        - **Saas Trial** - for following up with trial leads

* **Email Settings**:
    - **Click Tracking** on all emails
    - **Open Tracking** on all emails
    - Appropriate variable template syntax

* **Email Messaging**:
    - For each email step in your sequence, send yourself a test email to ensure formatting is appropriate and all variables are set correctly.

Once you have set your sequence up with the proper name, structure, settings and email messaging, return to the issue and tag your manager for approval. **If your manager rejects your sequence, you will need to make the necessary changes to gain their approval. If they have responded with their approval, you are cleared to move forward with setting your sequence live.**

#### Setting a Sequence Live
Go into the sequence settings and toggle the bar in the upper left from gray (paused) to green (active). You are now ready to use your sequence.

#### _For Managers_

#### Approving the Build of a New Sequence
* When deciding whether to approve or deny the creation of a new sequence, use your best judgment to decide whether this sequence really needs to be built, or if what the rep is looking for can be accomplished with an A/B test or by utilizing one of the existing ops-approved sequences. Is the sequence/step that is being replaced actually underperforming?
* If creation of the new sequence meets with your approval, go to the issue and add your approval. If you don’t approve, leave a comment explaining why the sequence has been denied.

#### Approving the Activation of a New Sequence
When deciding whether to approve or deny the activation of a new sequence, make sure the sequence follows all proper guidelines, including:
* Naming Convention
* Structure
* Sequence Settings
* Email Settings
    - Click/Open Tracking
    - Variable template syntax
* Sequence messaging is appropriate and acceptable

If all of these conditions are met, go back to the issue and add your approval. If the rep needs to revise anything before they can set it live, leave a comment explaining what they still need to do before they can begin using their sequence.

Managers then need to add a tag of “manager approved” on the sequence in Outreach


#### Post Sequence Live
30 day check - is the sequence meeting performance benchmarks?

# Sales Dev Manager Resources

## FY24Q3 Manager Tool Certification

We have an end-to-end process and tool walkthrough that walks manager through all the knowledge and information they need to know to be able to use our tech stack, both for inbound and outbound processes. The full walkthrough of this training is [documented on the issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/401). Moreover, abbreviated notes of the training can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chOoHvwk-dSsAwoloZhdGiJJoFz0yjjq07kOYmzQUvQ/edit).

## General leadership principles
This page will serve as a training resource and operational guide for current and future managers. All Sales Development Managers should follow the [general leadership
principles](/handbook/leadership/) set out in the handbook. 

- [1-1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)
- [Providing regular feedback](/handbook/leadership/#giving-feedback)
- [Dealing with underperformance](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/)

## Manager Onboarding
Onboarding is essential for all Sales Development Managers at GitLab. As part of onboarding, a [Becoming a GitLab Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/becoming-a-gitlab-manager.md) issue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.

### Outbound BDR Process Manager Onboarding

The BDR process that we have defined here in GitLab is meant to provide a repeatable set of steps that an outbound BDR can follow to achieve results. It is very important for an onboarding manager to align themselves as quickly as possible to this process as it is a proven method that will help them manage their team in a efficient and data-driven way. 

The BDR Process is explained step-by-step in the [main SDR handbook page here](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/#bdr-outbound-process)

For a newcoming manager, we provide the [Watch and Help Dashboards](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-development-tools/#tracking--monitoring-resources) that will be your main tool in understanding where your team is aligned to our BDR process, and where they need assistance. 

To help structure your usage of the above, you can follow the steps below during your first month at GitLab while [the document here will be your main go-to resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18k1_jDHVgNzy2SzcPZ7GAOdJ6zb9i37Z4-V1-dEFKiU/edit#)

| Action | Benefit | 
| ------ | ------- | 
| Clone the W&H Dashboard and edit each report to be exclusive to your team's names | Gives you a SSoT that you and your team can easily reference | 
| Review the dashboard with your team, and discuss how the data on it connect to the [BDR KPIs](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/#sdrbdr-roe-and-inbound-lead-management) | Allows you to understand your team's level of maturity and each team member's current level of alignment to existing processes |
| Take note of any discrepancies or points of feedback from the team, either transcribe them to 1:1s for individual conversations or to the SDR Issue board for org-wide improvements | Enables you to filter between discrepancies that are caused because of a team member's lack of diligence that should be improved upon by the individual OR for discrepancies that were caused by an org-wide operational shortcoming that should be improved upon on a global scale. |
| Set realistic expectations with the team about adherance to org KPIs and set a review mechanism to go over them on a reccuring basis | Helps maintain a repeatable structure of accountability for your entire team |

## Field Marketing <> BDR Collaboration Process

Our FM/BDR collaboration process is a method that we follow in the spirit of maximizing cross-functional collaboration. We have created an issue template for Field Marketers to populate, which in turns gets managed from the [Kanban Board here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5665082). The premise of the [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/FM_BDR_Collaboration_Template.md) and board is to streamline communication between our teams. The issue template very clearly articulates all next steps required of this process while it also tries to leave space for us much AdHoc collaboration as required for each specific event. 

As a BDR Director you will be tagged first in this issue as the primary DRI, while as a BDR Manager you will be involved in this issue on a case-by-case basis by your regional Director. All next steps of this process are clearly mentioned in the template for the issue so please follow each step in turn. The Sales Dev Operations team is also tagged and will be there to monitor progress and offer help if requested.

## Status Related 6Sense Reports

On folder #5 in the [6Sense segments list](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/manage), you'll find the templates for the main three categories of accounts that we have. These templates are meant to be cloned and edited for your teams as per the guidelines below and will assist with coaching on 1:1s and team calls, as well as driving more predictable pipeline building.

**[Currently Actively Working Accounts Template](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495284/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)**

* This report will cross-reference your team's currently AWAs against 6Sense intent data, and will highlight the best ICP accounts currently on your team's pipeline.

**[CE/SFDC Accounts not in Actively Working Status](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495296/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)**

* This report will highlight the best ICP accounts on our existing database, that are not actively being pursued by your team.

**[Greenfield Accounts not in Actively Workin](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495295/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)**

* This report will highlight the best ICP accounts that are NOt currently on our existing database. Please note that due to the complexity of our sales territories, there may be edits required on filter #8 (Address). There are multiple variants for City, Country or Region that can be used to accurately display each team's territory. Please feel free to reach out to the Ops team to help you determine these and generate the best reports possible. 

## Sales Dev Territory and Role Reports

**[Sales Dev by Salesforce Profile and Role - ](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gonx)**

* Sales Dev Ops profile is the only profile with the ability to help add a member to opps beyond stage 0 (we can't add SDR/BDR to closed won opps however)
* Certain roles have certain permissions ie. Team Lead roles are able to transfer leads. Director level roles are able to help when account assignments are incorrect by updating account address and employee size information.
* Roles determine visibility based on the region (AMER, APAC, EMEA). Example: a BDR with EMEA in their role, will be able to see all accounts where the account territory owner has EMEA in their territory role name.

**[Sales Dev Territories by Team role/member associated with each territory - ](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gpBL)**

* This allows you to see what members/roles are associated with each territory. When you need a change in BDR assignment to a territory, please sharethe territory name with Sales Dev Ops, not the name of the account. Search for the account owner name and tell Sales Dev Ops which territory/territories require that BDR to be assigned.

## Onboarding
GitLab People Connect Team members will [create the onboarding issue](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#timing) and start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than one week before the new team member joins. People Connect Team members require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire's start date to complete all onboarding tasks. This issue will be automatically assigned to you. As a manager, you will [also have tasks](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/#managers-of-new-team-members) that need to be completed prior to the new team member's start date. 

The general onboarding issue will also automatically add a ['Sales Development' section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_sales_development.md) under 'Job Specific Tasks' based on the role of the new SDR. Both you and your new hire will have tasks to complete in this section. 

With the creation of this issue, an [access request (AR) will also be automatically created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_sales_development) for a new team member on their second day at GitLab. This AR lists the role based entitlements (pre-defined groups and system-level access that are granted automatically to team members depending on their role) your new hire will need.
     *See what is being auto provisioned on this AR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_demand_generation). 

### New Hire's First Day
On your new hire's first day, the assigned People Connect Team member will [schedule a welcome email](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#day-1-onboarding-tasks) to arrive at 7:30am (local time of the new team member) on their start date detailing how your new hire can access GitLab and begin their onboarding process. 

### Manager Onboarding Checklist
##### Prior to Day 1
* Complete ‘Manager’ tasks on the onboarding issue *Note: there are tasks to complete prior to your new hire starting
* Schedule a welcome call at the start of your new hire’s first day to discuss:
     * Main focus should be completing as much of your onboarding as possible.
     * When you have available time feel free to move ahead as some onboarding task lists for the day won't take you all day.
     * How to manage meeting invites in your inbox (there are a ton!)
     * You will receive numerous emails in their first two weeks asking you to register or activate your license to a specific tool we use, please go ahead and do all of this.
     * What you can expect in regards to [onboarding at GitLab as an SDR](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sdr-playbook-onboarding/)
