## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Rules of Engagement (RoE)

This page is part of the Sales Development team's handbook [page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/) and aims to help structure the expectations of SDR and BDR roles. Below you'll find the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that we've designed to help you get results for customers as efficiently as possible. We additionally provide an explanation of our Rules of Engagement as well as a general Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section.

## Rules Of Engagement (RoE)


1. Is the MQL from an Existing Account?
 
**No:** It is worked by the SDR team <br>
**Yes:** Check the BDR Prospecting Status

2. Is the Account in “Actively Working” Status?

**No:** It is worked by the SDR team <br>
**Yes:** Check for Activity

3. Does the account have activity placed by the BDR in the last 30 days?

**Yes:** It is worked by the BDR Assigned. <br>

**No:** Check to see if there are leads related to the account that have activity using this report
When you modify this report based on company name and email domain, do you see any activity in the last 30 days? <br>
**Yes:** It is worked by the BDR Assigned <br>
**No:** It is worked by the SDR Team.

**Next Steps:** SDR chatters the BDR Assigned and lets them know you didn’t find activity and will go ahead and sequence the lead. FYI’s the BDR Manager. BDR Manager will work with the BDR to put the account into the correct BDR Prospecting status. If a BDR is able to relay information that was not picked up in the SDR’s research, the SDR should end the sequence if the prospect hasn’t engaged and change lead ownership to BDR so the BDR can reach out. If the SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between SDR and BDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.

4. Is the Account in “Queued” Status?

**Yes:** It is worked by the SDR team <br>

5. Is the Account in “Worked in FY” Status?

**Yes:** It is worked by the SDR team <br>

6. Is the Account in “Restricted” Status?

**Yes:** It should be routed to the BDR assigned. The BDR assigned will chatter the SAE about whether they’d like them to reach out or whether they would like to own that responsibility. The AE should respond within 48 hours.

- If they reply back that the BDR can work, the BDR will continue with the prospect as a lead record and take action.

- If they reply back that they want to be responsible, the BDR will convert the lead so that it becomes a contact.

After determining an MQL is to be worked by the SDR team:

7. Is the new MQL related to an existing MQL that is part of the same account?

**No:** The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin

**Yes:** Check the status of the existing MQL

8. Is the existing MQL in Accepted or Qualifying status?

**No:** The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin

**Yes:** Check the activity on the existing MQL

9. Is there activity in the last 30 days or a follow up task scheduled for the future?

**Yes:** The MQL should be worked by the owner of the existing MQL

**No:** The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin. If you are not sure, double-check with the related SDR.

If the related SDR relays information that was not picked up in the new SDR’s research, the new SDR should end any active sequence if the prospect hasn’t engaged and change lead ownership to the team member who has been engaged so they can reach out. If the new SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the new SDR and the related SDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### RoE Common Questions

**Q:** Should BDRs flag duplicate accounts? <br>
**A:** Yes. However, they do not have the ability to merge it themselves so should chatter @Sales Support to do it.

**Q:** How do we resolve a dispute over SAO credit?<br>
**A:** SDR and BDR first try to talk through a solution If no agreement: Managers will determine a solution If no agreement between the managers: Escalate to Senior Leadership Double credit nor double compensation will be given

**Q:** Who will be handling inquiries from an SDR/BDR standpoint? <br> 
**A:** Inquiries will go to an open queue. SDR’s will not work them. We want to give marketing time to progress these to MQLs. <br>
**A:** BDR’s can work leads in all statuses if they are related to their “Actively working” accounts. Outreach to these leads would be part of their account strategy.

**Q:** What if a prospect comes back directly to the BDR much delayed, when the account is not marked as “Actively Working” anymore, but resulting from personalized messaging? <br>
**A:** Yes, if they email, reply via LI, or call the BDR directly, the BDR will need to check that the lead is in queue ownership. If so, they must move the account back to “Actively Working”, so that the lead can be put into their ownership.

**Q:** Why are my leads being reassigned to Inquiry Queue? <br> 
**A:** Marketing Operations has a daily scheduled clean at 10:30 PM EST/EDT that update Status = Inquiry to Inquiry Queue. To prevent the reassignment, you’ll want to update the leads from Inquiry to Accepted or add to an Outreach sequence.

**Q:** What should BDRs do when a prospect or contact responds with a complince related question or objects to being contacted? <br>
**A:** Immediately reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help and forward any email from the contact to dpo@gitlab.com.
