description: "A guide for incidents that may occur on the Marketing site"
---


## Overview

This page offers insights into incidents occurring on the GitLab marketing site, delineates methods to assess severity levels, and outlines avenues for obtaining support.

At the outset, it's important to note the diverse composition of our marketing site, consisting of multiple projects. While all deployments converge into the same GCP bucket, they employ varying technologies for website generation.

1. The Marketing site is composed of multiple repositories: the [blog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/gitlab-blog), [www](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com), [navigation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation), and [buyer experience](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience). 

1. Each repository's pages are generated during the build process and uploaded as artifacts to a single GCP bucket. Upon pipeline execution, all artifacts are consolidated within the `/public` directory on our GCP bucket.

### Alerting

1. The Digital Experience Team receives automatic alerts for 404 incidents flagged by Quantum Metric in our [#dex-alerts](https://app.slack.com/client/E03N1RJJX7C/C04N3EBAR36) Slack channel.

2. An automated job runs every Friday, generating a issue for all broken links. [Example issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/3676).

### What level is this incident?

The following are the questions to consider when determining incident severity:

1. What's the impact level of the marketing site outage?

1. How extensive is the incident? It's crucial to assess beyond the number of affected individuals, considering:
  1. The total number of impacted users.
  1. The potential impact on various categories of our key stakeholders.
  1. Whether the incident affects significant customers or partners, regardless of the scale.
1. Are any affected individuals influential among our key audiences or stakeholders?
1. Does the incident directly affect our core business operations?
1. Have we encountered a similar incident in the past? In essence, is this a recurring issue for the company?
