# Marketing cookie

The Digital Experience team uses the `about_gitlab_active_user` cookie as a tool to customize content on the `about.gitlab.com` domain.

This cookie determined if a user has an active sesssion within the GitLab product. No user information is passed to the cookie and it expires with the session. This implementation is on `gitlab.com` domain so it will propagate down to all subdomains.
