## Notes about tabbing across browsers

Different browsers respond differently to tabbing through interactive elements (like links, buttons, form inputs, etc.) on a page. Chrome and chromium based browsers will have `tab` move to the next focusable element and `shift + tab` will have move back a focusable element. This is done to assist folks with screen readers.

Safari doesn't use tab navigation by default. The user has to go into Safari's setting and check the box to turn on tabbed navigation. Mozilla is being true to operating system settings in Mac OS, which means you also need to turn it on.

### Guidance to tackling accessibility challenges related to tabbing

* Properly set `tabindex`: You can use the `tabindex` attribute to specify the order in which elements receive focus when the user uses the `tab` key.

* Properly use ARIA roles: [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) roles provide a way to make web content is accessible to people with disabilities. They can be used to define the role of an element, helping assistive technologies understand how to interact with it.

* Consistent design: Ensure that your design visually indicates which element currently has keyboard focus (ex: by changing the color or outline). This visual cue _will help all users_, not just those using assistive technologies.

## More comprehensive testing

Tools like Axe and Google Lighthouse only take you so far, and are a good starting point for us. Using screen reader technology like [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/voiceover/vo2682/mac) on MacOS to test on a real webpage is needed to reach AA compliance.
