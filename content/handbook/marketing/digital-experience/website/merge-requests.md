## How to give good reviews

* Review the description and discussions in the MR and any related issues.
* Identify what will need to be tested.
* Look at the specific code changes in the MR to see how the site could be impacted by those changes.
* Check to see if any of the updated items are shared by other locations.
* Validate expected functionality 

## As the reviewer, ask yourself these questions

1. Do the changes impact what they are supposed to impact as expected?
1. Do the changes impact something they are **not** supposed to impact?
1. Check relevant browsers.
    * Relevant browsers are those which a significant percentage of our end-users utilize.
1. Check relevant device resolutions.

## Add the appropriate labels for triage

In most cases, reviews will have the `dex-approval::2-standard` tag by default. This should be sufficient for _most_ changes. If you are working with a sensitive change, use the following approval process as a resource: [Approvel levels in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/marketing-site-approval-process/#approval-levels) 

##  Tag the appropriate people for review

Use your best judgement in asking reviews from others. Note that key pages will need higher authorization for reviews, and their process may move slower as a result.
