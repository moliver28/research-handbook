## About me

Grown up in Linz, Austria, I wanted to understand how a computer works in school. A 486 PC turbo-boost button that was not enabled by default inspired me to study Hardware/Software Systems Engineering, leading to circuit design, hardware and software programming languages, and more. A student's dorm network project in Vienna, Austria, allowed me to dive into spanning trees and routing, which I expanded on with DNS and routing protocols at the University of Vienna, Computer Center. Maintaining an open-source monitoring project for 11 years required me to understand how the software is used in production. CVEs raised awareness about security scanning. I therefore engaged with global events and community meetups to learn and understand the roles in modern DevSecOps workflows. My passion for open-source communities also inspired me to move to Nuremberg, Germany, in 2012, where I live in the countryside.

Outside of work, you'll find me building LEGO models, exploring nature, and travelling. More on my personal website: https://dnsmichi.at/about/

### My work values

- **I always [assume positive intent](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent).** and encourage others to do the same.
- **I love transparency, and keeping everyone SAFE.** I work in public by default, with a [low level of shame](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame).
- **We are [managers of one](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one).** I will go with a bias for action and not ask for permission to propose an idea, MR, action.
- **[Say why, not just what](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#say-why-not-just-what).** Understanding the _why_ helps me validate decisions, and make better proposals. Merge Requests without a description can lead to questions in Slack, or otherwise back-and-forth communication. Time that could be used more efficiently.
- **[Handbook first](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first).** If something is wrong or not documented in the handbook, it is a bug, and we should start an issue or a merge request.
- **I love project management.** GitLab issues, epics, labels, due dates, and overall tracking. This provides transparency and results reporting, and enables efficient collaboration.
- **I believe in "Everyone can contribute".** Technical problems, product features, handbook updates, etc. need to be broken down, and explained on everyone's knowledge level. If you see me testing your knowledge in a conversation, be honest and frank and let me know if it is too low level, or instead needs a more in-depth explanation.
- **There is only one [Single Source of Truth](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth)**, and it is discoverable by all team members async.
- **Slack is not a knowledge base** (and [messages will expire after 90 days](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#slack)). Every Slack thread should be summarized and broken down into actionnable issues.
- **I follow [disagree, commit, advocate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#disagree-and-commit)** and trust that decisions can be changed.
- **I often step on everyone's toes.** My role requires cross-functional knowledge. Learning and discussing outside my comfort zone and expertise keeps me challenged, and requires a safe environment where [short toes are the default](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#short-toes).
- **I love [honest and actionnable feedback](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#give-feedback-effectively).** Do not feel intimidated to share feedback -- use a private message, or schedule a coffee chat to help me grow.
- **[No agenda, no attenda](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#external-communication)**. If a calendar invite does not attach a Google document, or has an empty agenda, I will not attend in sync.
- **Inclusive communication**: We are an all-remote global company. I will remind everyone to [use ISO dates and time zones, and provide clear due dates](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#communicating-dates-and-time).
- **Manual work is a bug.** If you see me using [quick actions](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/18/improve-your-gitlab-productivity-with-these-10-tips/), terminal commands, or writing scripts for the GitLab API, it often is because the manual work will continously consume too much time. And I also love challenges. Do not hesitate to ask to learn more. We can do "pair programming" coffee chats together.
- **Trust needs to be earned.** I will work hard to earn yours.

## Availability and communication preferences

- I prefer asynchronous written communication.
    - GitLab issues, MRs, forum topics > Slack, Discord
    - I love [low-context communication](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#top-tips-and-best-practices), adding all context so that everyone can continue when I sign off, or am focussed on other tasks.
- Ask in [public Slack channels](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#use-public-channels), so that everyone can contribute.
    - This can help to loop in more team members, DRIs and subject matter experts.
    - Please avoid DMs, unless it is private feedback or otherwise confidential. I'll answer DMs with less priority than public requests.
- I love helping in public, and sometimes stay for longer work hours to help with incidents or late night tasks (after 10 AM PT, which is 7 PM CET).
    - If I need to leave during a planned task, I will communicate the sign-off time, and provide a handover summary.
- If you think that a regular coffee chat, or topic specific sync makes sense for more efficiency or impactful results, propose a new calendar event, and add an agenda document.
- My work hours cover AMER and EMEA timezones.
    - Meetings can be scheduled in my afternoon (5 AM to 10 AM PT, 2 PM CET to 7 PM CET). My mornings are reserved for focus time, or shopping/extended lunch.
    - Ask when scheduling into focus time blocks (customer calls, EMEA syncs, etc.).

## Finding me

I go as `dnsmichi` everywhere: Slack, [GitLab.com profile](https://gitlab.com/dnsmichi), [GitLab forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/u/dnsmichi/summary), social media, personal website: https://dnsmichi.at/. Except for email/calendar where you need to find my full name `Michael Friedrich` or short `mfriedrich`. I love coffee chats, please schedule and do not ask for permission. :-)

I love connecting with team members on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dnsmichi/), and amplify your shares into my network (hiring, product/engineering insights, marketing, etc.). Tips for social media messaging are documented in the [Developer Advocacy on Social Media handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/). I'm mostly active on social media, but have push notifications disabled. I also avoid social media during vacation to relax and keep my mental health.

My private mobile number is in my Slack profile. Please do not share it with anyone, I don't want to get spam calls or phishing attempts. If a web form asks for a phone number, use the [company phone number](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#company-phone-number) instead. You can connect with me through WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal which is more reliable during travel and events with location sharing and dinner coordination.

## Expertise

I love creating tutorials, workshops and trainings about GitLab use cases. In my previous company, I authored the GitLab training, and continued building [workshops in my role as Developer Advocate at GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/projects/#workshops). I also run Linux in cloud VMs, containers, Kubernetes amd Raspberry Pis in production. This keeps me busy learning Ansible, and building in public.

I usually try to understand the big picture, and always want to look behind the curtain. [GitLab Duo](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/) and AI required me to learn everything from scratch again. Finding a strategy to learn, and scheduling coffee chats with product and engineering team members allowed me to expand my expertise, and also led to the [GitLab Duo Coffee Chat on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kp5uj_JgQiSvHw1jQu0mSVZ), a boring solution. I am interested in many cloud-native and DevSecOps technologies, but often reduce my scope after understanding the basics, blockers and challenges. For example, I invested into [learning eBPF in FY24](https://o11y.love/topics/ebpf/#learning-resources) and created [workshops for GitLab Summit 2024](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/workshops/gitlab-summit-2024) to share the knowledge with team members, but did not identify an immediate business impact for the Observability group.

I also thrive in areas where I am not an expert in, but someone asked for help, providing a real use case. For example, the [GitLab Duo adoption](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/-/epics/475) in a customer enviroment requires me to learn Java Spring Boot. My knowledge about GitLab features continuously sources from [helping users on the forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/u/dnsmichi/activity).

My role as developer advocate enables me to take different hats: Provide product feedback from different user persona's views, evaluate marketing messaging, or generally brainstorm about product feature ideas and architecture. Feel free to loop me into UX workflows, architecture proposals, product roadmaps, or website design for different target personas.

I'm a leader within GitLab, and happy to share my knowledge and expertise with everyone. I'm an ally and support underrepresented groups in my [mentoring and coaching](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/mentoring-coaching/) activities.

## Strengths and weaknesses

### Strengths

- **I'm a fast learner.** I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, whether it's learning a new programming language, framework, or technology. I enjoy tackling challenges and finding creative solutions.
- **I'm adaptable.** I'm comfortable working in a variety of environments and can quickly adjust to changing priorities or requirements. I'm able to pivot and find new ways to contribute when needed.
- **I document everything.** Depending on the scope, a [handbook MR](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/content-sites/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=all&author_username=dnsmichi) or GitLab issue is not far away. You can help me with your bias for action, and also assign handbook MRs for review.
- **I love connecting everyone.** I'm not shy to engage in important discussions to help company goals, or cross-functional work, often in [key Slack channels](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/chat/#key-slack-channels) or epics. I usually leave the conversation afterwards. If you need something from me later on, please explicitely tag me and ask.
- **I'm a team player and prioritize helping other's achieve their results.** I take the time to unblock processes and results, or contribute ideas to iterate faster.
- **I know a lot of things.** [My career](https://dnsmichi.at/about/) touches on many different technical topics and open-source collaboration. I'm here to share my knowledge and help you advance your goals and career.

### Weaknesses

- **I'm passionate about my work.** Sometimes, I push for my opinion as the best path forward, although I am not the DRI. I can also be [direct](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#directness) which can come across as overbearing at times. I am working on being more mindful of this and balancing my passion with consideration for others' perspectives.
- **I say yes too often.** I'm constantly challenged with many requests and own ideas, and reprioritize often. The [Eisenhower Matrix](https://slab.com/blog/eisenhower-matrix/) on my desk helps with `do, schedule, delegate, delete` decisions. I might forget about requests that are not tracked in an issue with a due date and to-do assignment (Google docs, Slack, Email). Be proactive, and create [Developer Advocacy requests](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/#want-to-work-with-the-team) and assign them to me.
- **My native language is German, not English.** I have a vocabulary weakness for day-to-day items (e.g. kitchen and food). I'm learning through coffee chats, social conversations, and use Grammarly to improve my English. When I share a tip to `make you more efficient`, this does not mean that you are not efficient. Instead, I am always looking for ways to help others benefit from my discovered efficiency tips.
- **I'm not good at email.** If I should follow-up in an external email conversation, you might have to remind me to do so.
- **I occassionally fall into old habits and aim for perfection and completeness**. Minimal viable changes, boring solutions and [iteration](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration) are challenging sometimes. If you see me writing a long tutorial blog post, or a capture-everything issue, please jump in and remind me of breaking down the tasks.


## Thanks for reading

I hope you've learned a lot about me in this README. If you want to know more, or peek into [my remote workspace background](https://dnsmichi.at/all-remote-workspace/), schedule a coffee chat.
