## GCP - CUD process outline ( Testing )

The GCP (Google Cloud Platform) CUD (Committed Use Discount) process involves the following steps:

1. **Assess your GCP resource usage**: Analyze your current and projected GCP resource usage to determine the appropriate CUD commitment level.

2. **Determine the CUD commitment term**: Choose the CUD commitment term (1 year or 3 years) that best fits your GCP usage needs.

3. **Purchase the CUD**: Procure the CUD commitment through the GCP Console or by working with your Google sales representative.

4. **Monitor and optimize**: Continuously monitor your GCP resource usage and adjust your CUD commitment as needed to maximize cost savings.

By following this CUD process, you can take advantage of significant cost savings on your GCP resource usage and optimize your cloud infrastructure costs.
