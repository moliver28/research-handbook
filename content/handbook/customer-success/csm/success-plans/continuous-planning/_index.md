when building customer-facing success plans based on information maintained in customer collaboration groups. Anyone can use the tools to present updates on ongoing initiatives within their GitLab projects."

## Philosophy

When preparing for an executive business review or a similar presentation, it's common to create slide-based presentations that reflect the success or progress of a project. Traditionally, this process requires manually gathering information from various sources. However, if you use GitLab to track project progress, you might already document key objectives or milestones as epics or issues within these groups. This documentation is valuable because it's actively maintained during daily activities.

However, extracting information from these sources and incorporating it into a slide deck remains a manual process â€” but it doesn't have to be. Imagine that while maintaining your customer collaboration groups, you follow a few standard guidelines for setting up epics and issues. For example, you might assign standardized labels to epics representing key objectives or write descriptions using a structured template. This approach makes the information machine-readable, allowing you to automate at least part of the slide deck creation process, thereby enhancing efficiency.

By automating as much of the process as possible and utilizing scheduled CI/CD pipelines to run the automation regularly, we arrive at what we call __Continuous Planning__. This approach saves time and ensures that the presentation assets are always up-to-date and available to stakeholders at any time, shifting the focus from manual updates to continuous generation.

## Direction and how you can help

ðŸ‘‹ This is the strategy for [Continuous Planning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning), a tool the Customer Success Management (CSM) team created to standardize creating success plans for customers.

This strategy is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute. Sharing your feedback directly in the [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning/-/issues) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning/-/epics) is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.

## Overview

__Continuous Planning__ focuses on automating the creation of presentation materials by leveraging information from GitLab groups and projects. By standardizing how CSMs document customers' objectives and initiatives and utilizing CI/CD pipelines and GraphQL, we ensure that these materials are up-to-date and easily accessible to anyone who needs them.

## What we recently completed

- Converted Continuous Planning from private to an open-source project so any users organizing work with GitLab epics and issues can create standardization for documenting and presenting work.

## What we are currently working on

Our [issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning/-/boards) provides detailed insight into everything currently in flight.

- Using a GraphQL query to collect all success plans within the GitLab [account-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management) subgroup in one area. - This will allow managers and other team members working on an account to find the associated success plan for that customer.

- [Improve the efficiency of success plan data collection](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning/-/epics/5) - This update decreases the pipeline run time by 60%.

- [AMER Rollout (Q3)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning/gitlab-profile/-/issues/9) - All AMER CSMs will move their existing success plans to using Continuous Planning by the end of October.

## What's next for us

- [EMEA and APJ Rollout (Q4)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-sales-continuous-planning/gitlab-profile/-/issues/10) - We'll take our learnings from the AMER rollout and proceed with the rollout to the EMEA and APJ regions.

## Future thinking

- We'll iterate on Continuous Planning to have an API layer that runs a GraphQL query, combining the benefits from the two variations of Continuous Planning we're using today and moving forward with a unified standard.

- We want to extend Continuous Plannings usage beyond CSMs to other GitLab business units and customers. For example, Product Managers can use Continuous Planning to update the "What we recently completed" and "What we're currently working on" sections of their group direction page. The PS team can use it to highlight updates to customers.

- Work with the Gainsight admins to import the data collected from success plans into Gainsight.
