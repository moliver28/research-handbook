title: "CSM Internship Program"

---






This page describes best practices for an [internship for learning](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/internship-for-learning/) with the CSM team.

Internships are a great way for a GitLab team member to learn about being a Customer Success Manager at GitLab. Use this guide for planning and executing an internship under an IC CSM who acts as the 'Intern Mentor'.

## How to find a mentor in the CSM team

The first step you will need to take in order to start an internship in Customer Success is to find a mentor from the [CSM team](/company/team/?department=csm). Feel free to reach out to any CSMs, particularly ones who are in a similar timezone to you to discuss an internship, or to reach out to a CSM Manager for guidance.

If you're not sure who to reach out to, you can also post in the [#customer-success](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C5D346V08) Slack channel and express your interest in an internship and that you are looking for a mentor.


## Internship expectations

An internship with the CSM team typically lasts 3 months and is intended for the intern to get hands-on experience of being a CSM, so that they can make a decision if being a CSM is aligned with their career goals and if so will be ready to apply for a position when one opens. Completing the internship is not a guarantee of moving into a CSM role.

Interns and mentors should agree to a regular cadence of meeting. The recommendation is a weekly 30-minute call, perhaps extending to 1-hour depending on the agenda. The intern should be ready and able to commit at least 8 hours per week to the internship (20% time).

## Pre-internship tasks

1. The intern must get approval from their manager to participate in the internship
1. The intern must get agreement from a CSM to be their mentor
1. The mentor must get approval from their manager to participate in the internship
1. All parties (intern, mentor, and the two managers) must agree on a start date and weekly time commitment
1. The intern can optionally open an issue in the [People Ops Training project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Training/issues/new) using the **Internship for learning** template
1. The intern is responsible for scheduling a weekly recurring 1:1 with their mentor to foster regular communication regarding intern role and responsibilities, which will include creating and maintaining a notes doc to document the internship plan, progress, and take notes during weekly 1:1s
1. The mentor will add the intern to the [#timtams](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/G8F1W2AGM) Slack channel, Global CSM biweekly team call, and the mentor's team call
1. The intern is expected to provide feedback on their experiences and receive feedback and guidance throughout the internship

### Timeline and Framework

Interns and mentors can follow the below guidelines to guide the internship and ensure the intern has a full range of exposure to being a CSM.

#### Week 1

1. The intern and mentor will have their first call, in which they will to get to know each other, agree on what they intend to get out of the internship, and align on the plan.
