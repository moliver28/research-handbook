Onboarding for Customer Success Managers is a guided, methodical process to ensure new team members have the knowledge they need to be effective.

There is a lot to learn to make you a great GitLab Customer Success Manager. It is important for new team members to gain competency on how our platform solutions provide customer value, and how we partner with customers to build a productive relationship. This handbook page will provide an overview of what can be expected during the onboarding journey including learning objectives, milestones, and ways in which a manager and onboarding buddy can support a new team member during their onboarding.

Please share your feedback in the following issue: [CSM Onboarding Feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/2063). 

## Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since GitLab is a [handbook first](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to any question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available as this is our [Single Source of Truth (SSoT)](/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth).

If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please be sure to reach out to your Manager; Onboarding Buddy; People Connect Team member or Enablement Program Manager for support by tagging them in the comments section of this issue. If you need to troubleshoot specific issues with tools, you can add a screenshot of the issue directly in the comment to help them diagnose the problem.

Alternatively once you are active on [Slack](/handbook/communication/chat), which is used solely for informal communication, you will notice that you have been automatically added to a handful of useful support channels such #questions, #cs-questions, #solutions-architects, #it-help, etc.

## Meeting shadowing

To learn how we conduct both customer meetings and internal planning meetings, a new team member will shadow these meetings with one or more established members of the team.

[Meeting Shadowing](/handbook/customer-success/csm/csm-onboarding/shadowing/)

## CSM Office Hours

We host weekly CSM office hours meetings to help you answer questions in a judgment-free space. You can add your questions to the agenda document linked in the Google Calendar invite and hop on the call to work through questions or learn how to find helpful resources.

## Helpful resources for faster onboarding

By talking to new hires and recent new CSM team members, it was identified that the onboarding buddy relationship plays a critical role for success of a new hire in the CSM team. Existing CSMs explained that having a very close / short loop to their onboarding saw a close relationship as a tremendous speed up of their onboarding.

Buddies should always be CSMs (same department), to match the role as close as possible, as it will help the new hire to resolve questions around their responsibilities and tasks quicker and more efficient, compared to going through multiple chats or calls. To pick an onboarding buddy, CSM managers [will use the guidance section for buddies](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/#managers-who-should-i-pick-as-an-onboarding-buddy) from our general handbook section.

### SLACK Channels

New team members often struggle to find the right set of slack channels to participate in, and to filter out noise that is not relevant to them, especially in the first weeks of their start in the CSM team. The following list should provide an initial set of channels that will be helpful to new hires.

- **CSM - General**

  - #cs-questions
  - #customer-success
  - #sales-support
  - #field-fyi
  - #csm-updates
  - #tim-tams

- **GitLab - General**

  - #questions
  - #whats-happening-at-gitlab
  - #company-fyi
  - #it-help
  - #ai_field_strategy
  - #people-connect
  - #escalated_customers
  - #thanks
  - #whats-happening-at-gitlab

- **CSM - Regional - EMEA / DACH Team**

  - #team-csm-dach
  - #emea-customer-success
  - #team-csm-emea
  - #social-csm-emea

For all product management related questions, a CSM should review our handbook page at [following location](/handbook/product/categories/features/) to identify the right channel for the topic they are looking to learn more. Those team channels should be asked if there is no documentation available for the problem/question and also if the CSM did not find an issue that already discusses this question.

A great resource to learn how to engage with GitLab product is [available in the product handbook here](/handbook/product/how-to-engage/)
