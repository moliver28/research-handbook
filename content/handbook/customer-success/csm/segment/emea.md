## Overview

CSMs aligned with customers in EMEA can use this handbook page to help define their processes and approaches that are unique to their segment. 

### GitLab Duo / AI - Interaction with customers

EMEA CSMs regular engage with customers and drive adoption of GitLab's AI and machine learning capabilities. This should include:

- Hosting regular GitLab Duo sessions to showcase the latest AI/ML features and use cases
- Identifying customers who could benefit from GitLab's AI solutions and scheduling demos
- Providing guidance and best practices for implementing GitLab's AI tools
- Collecting customer feedback to inform future product roadmap

By actively promoting GitLab's AI offerings, EMEA CSMs can help customers unlock the full potential of the platform and drive increased value and engagement.

#### Funneling back customer feedback on GitLab Duo / AI to GitLab product

To further improve GitLab Duo / AI, its crucial for CSMs to provide the collected feedback from their customer interactions back to the product team. This should be done by creating a new issue and providing the details required by product team. Additionally, and depending on the importance, the CSM can also reach out to the product team directly in SLACK, also if PM is not responsive in the issue which was created by the CSM. 

Either create a bug or feature proposal for the general AI product teams.

- [For a bug, use this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Bug)
- [For a feature proposal, use this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Proposal%20-%20lean)

Issue information should include:

- Setting the label **AI-powered** + **Data Science** 
- Assignment / tagging of the corresponding product manager - [See here for details](/handbook/product/categories/features/#ai-powered)
