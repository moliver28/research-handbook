## January 2024

### AMER Time Zone Webinars & Labs


#### Hands-on Lab: Security and Compliance in GitLab
##### January 24th, 2023 at 9:00-11:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-2:00PM Eastern Time

In this lab we will focus on how you can secure your application with GitLab. 

We will first take a look at how to apply scanners to your CICD pipelines in a hands-on exercise so that any vulnerabilities are caught as soon as the code is committed. 

Next, we will look at compliance frameworks and pipelines to show how you can ensure no one within your development teams is cutting corners and exposing your application.

#### Security and Compliance
##### January 26th, 2024 at 9:00-10:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-1:00PM Eastern Time

GitLab enables developers and security to work together in a single tool, allowing for proactive security or “shifting left”. This session will cover what GitLab offers, how scan results integrate seamlessly with merge requests, and how to use the Security Dashboard to manage vulnerabilities.
