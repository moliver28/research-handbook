## December 2023

### AMER Time Zone Webinars & Labs

#### Hands-on Workshop: Security and Compliance in GitLab
##### December 20th, 2023 at 9:00-11:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-2:00PM Eastern Time

In this workshop we will focus on how you can secure your application with GitLab. 

We will first take a look at how to apply scanners to your CICD pipelines in a hands-on exercise so that any vulnerabilities are caught as soon as the code is committed. 

Next, we will look at compliance frameworks and pipelines to show how you can ensure no one within your development teams is cutting corners and exposing your application.
