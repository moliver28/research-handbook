The Success Services department is part of the [Customer Success](/handbook/customer-success/) function who partners with our customers to deliver value and positive business outcomes throughout their journey with GitLab.

The team can be reached in [Slack channel](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05US54ETB3) (internal only).

## Success Services

### Overview

Our Success Services drive adoption and value realization of GitLab products whilst providing customers with Best Practices and a higher tier of White Glove support.   We achieve this by bundling a named Support Engineer, a Customer Success Architect (CSA) and Education services into a single orderable SKU as an annual renewable service.

The [Assigned Support Engineer (ASE)](/handbook/support/workflows/assigned-support-engineer/) is the primary point of contact for their customers and will  triage any support ticket logged by that customer.  Over time, because of this consistent resourcing, the knowledge of the customer's needs, environment and architecture results in faster resolution times to the most common logged issues.

The [Customer Success Architect (CSA)](/job-families/sales/customer-success-architect/) is accountable for their customer's success through GitLab product adoption using well understood Best Practices.  CSA's bring deeper product knowledge and technical depth than the industries traditional CSM role.  With experience across many customers, they are experts at ensuring features are leveraged the right way for maximum value.   This customer experience has lead to development of best practice content and prescriptive road-maps.  This content is folded into the Success Services offering as "Accelerators".

> Customer Success is not permitted to be "Hands on Keyboard" with customers.   We can and do provide best practices, architectural guidance and will tailor adoption and success plans to a specific customer need.  If a customer needs GitLab to develop a bespoke solutions or actively change or manage their configuration, we will need to engage our [Professional Services](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/) team.

Education Services included with Success Services encompasses 1day of Instructor-led Training  as well as a significant number of Training Certification Exam vouchers.   This enables us to partner the running of specific accelerators, aligned to training and certification, to ensure your team is ready and able to drive the cost benefits that GitLab brings.

### Accelerators

Success Services include up to 4 Accelerators, 1 per quarter, that your [Customer Success Architect (CSA)](/handbook/customer-success/csm/segment/csa/) will deliver.

> An accelerator is a customized form of enablement that a GitLab CSA will define and deliver to a customer. These accelerators span a quarter and they're mapped to your mutual success plan.

An Accelerator, depending on customer requirements and defined outcomes, will pull together one or more of the below content modules.   Typically the accelerator runs over 12 weeks.  It kicks off with a discovery workshop to document required customer outcomes.  From that, we will run a planning workshop outlining with the customer the steps necessary to achieve their outcomes.   The output of the Planning Workshop is a backlog of issues logged, in a GitLab project, that includes all the necessary activities that will be managed over the following 10 weeks to achieve those outcomes and close out the Accelerator

## CSA Processes

We have CSA specific processes that go above and beyond the CSM role. It is expected that this is layered on top of the CSM processes and responsibilities.

### SPS Customer Onboarding

1. Introduction Email
   1. Utilize [this internal email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDj4zSzuHega_wvZrWMkOC9TAWMWs_bjVwnn7GeJzzY/edit) and customize to your customer's needs
   2. The first priority is getting the kick-off call locked in so that you can review the program and get in front of the customer

2. Kick-off Call
   1. Scheduled via the introduction email for at 1 - 2 weeks out
   2. Internal prep call for the CSA to perform knowledge transfer and coordinate with the account team on what is the priority work to wrap an accelerator around
   3. Utilize the slide [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uQpuSwPV43ZkNvG18y_XBRRoBaCtWiyhYoHHAT3QBY4/edit) (internal)
   4. Share the .pdf version post call as well as immediate next steps, such as a discovery workshop
   
### Logging Accelerator Events

In order to keep track of key deliverables in the Accelerator process, CSAs need to log these events in Gainsight. This will allow reporting and a complete account timeline within Gainsight.

Instructions:

1. Add new activity (utilize the calendar plugin to auto-populate details of the meeting)
2. Select customer
3. "Activity Type" = "CSA Engagement"
4. Choose "Acceleratory Type". Use your best judgement to categorize the type of activity it is:
   * Agile Planning
   * CI
   * CD
   * Security
   * AI
   * Compliance
   * System Administration
5. Fill in "Accelerator Content Module"
   * Use this optional field to document the activity itself
   * i.e. "Delivered guidance report for cost optimization", or "Custom Security Policy Workshop"
