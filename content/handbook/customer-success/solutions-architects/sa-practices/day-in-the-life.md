# Day In The Life of a Developer


Every company is developing software. Whether it is external facing applications, or internal applications, or both.  Every company wants to be more efficient at developing software, as it has a direct correlation with the company's success.  GitLab is positioned to help every company create better applications by providing capabilities throughout the application delivery process including development, operations and security.  In the past, there was not one solution to help companies develop software from idea to deployment.  Companies relied on purchasing specific products for specific capabilities, and/or used manual methods such as email, spreadsheets, and documents to keep track of their development.    

The purpose of the Day In The Life of a Developer is to understand the company's current development process, look for opportunities for improvement, and relay those findings back to our stakeholders.  These improvement opportunities can then be communicated back in the form of an executive brief where prescriptive guidance can be shared, providing an explanation of where, how, and at what level of effort may be required as we partner with the customer to make those improvements. 

A Day In The Life of a Developer is a demonstration by the company that allows for deeper discovery around how the process currently works and where areas can be improved.  The demonstration usually can be done within a 90 minute meeting, with appropriate attendees, and active discussion regarding the process.

### Qualify

Day In The Life of a Developer requires commitment by both the GitLab field teams and our prospects and customers. To ensure the appropriate return on this investment of time, the opportunities should meet the following criteria:

- The account has a total addressable market of at least 100 GitLab users
- The prospect or customer is focused on improving their software delivery performance
- We have a relationship with the [economic buyer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/meddppicc/#economic-buyer)
- We have identified and established a relationship with the [champion](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/meddppicc/#champion)
- We suggest pitching a Day In The Life of a Developer prior to a Proof of Value (PoV) to understand bottlenecks and development opportunities important to the company's stakeholders. This also gives us an opportunity to agree upon success criteria for value drivers if a PoV is required for deal closure.

In case a Day In The Life of a Developer is conducted by a customer success manager (CSM), the following criteria should be met:
- We have identified and established a relationship with the champion
- The account has a total addressable market of at least 100 GitLab users
- The customer has expressed a strong desire to improving their software delivery performance

Key indicators that the opportunity is well-suited include:

- There is a specific initiative to accomplish one or more of the following by a specific date
    - Modernize a specific application or applications
    - Deliver a new critical application to the market
    - Transform or objectively improve their ability to deliver software
    - Modernize their DevOps capabilities
- The customer is currently using some features of GitLab and is interested in how leveraging more of the platform will drive software delivery outcomes
- For customer success, a Day In The Life of a Developer should help uncover opportunities to expand into new use cases or improve current adoption by identifying bottlenecks in the current software delivery process
- An existing customer shows interest in adopting our Day In The Life of a Developer approach to drive software delivery performance

The scope of a Day In The Life of a Developer should always be clearly defined. A clearly defined scope ensures that the correct people are being included in the team and reduces the risk of time lost agreeing what should be focused on. For this reason, the scope of a GitLab facilitated assessment must always be within the DevSecOps space.

### Education and Commitment

A successful Day In The Life of a Developer requires a commitment by the software delivery stakeholders and the personnel experienced with the various processes that constitute their development process. Without understanding the assessment process and its value to their organization, key participants will lack the commitment to ensure a successful Day In The Life of a Developer. Educate the prospect or customer on the benefits, process details, and the required commitment. 

_While a Day In The Life of a Developer is an advanced discovery workshop, it's expected that initial [opportunity discovery](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/playbook/discovery/) and [technical discovery](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/technical-discovery/) have been conducted._

#### Key Benefits

- Discovery and documentation of the Day In The Life of a Developer or "path to production" currently in place
    - Establish an agreed upon baseline from which to measure the progress of software delivery performance
    - Identify manual configuration touchpoints and handoffs and other bottlenecks
    - Create a process improvement roadmap
    - Understand the return on investment of a value delivery platform
    - Promote collaboration amongst traditionally siloed functions within the DevSecOps lifecycle

After the prospect or customer understands the process and its benefits, confirm commitment from the stakeholders and workshop participants by scheduling the facilitated workshop and/or interviews. Estimate the duration of the assessment and set the expectation that the documented software development process, recommendations, and readout will be delivered.

#### What is The Required Time Commitment?

Focusing on the goals and benefits listed above, the time required to complete a minimally viable Day In The Life of a Developer will vary from organization to organization. The workshop should NOT require exhaustive discussion and research. Depending on the availability and commitment of the various participants and stakeholders, the practice will take 90 minutes to two hours for a demonstration and discovery to take place.

### Prepare

Usually, through discovery, there is some level of knowledge of the current development process from a development perspective.  The idea of the Day In The Life is to understand the entire development process from idea to deployment to production, to look for areas of improvement throughout.  

Prepare for the Day In The Life of a Developer, by having notes on what is known to be able to reference, to insuring they are addressed.


### Pitch

The initial customer pitch allows us to identify key stakeholders & get their buy in. The customer pitch should include:
- What is a Day In The Life of a Developer?
- What does a Day In The Life of a Developer entail?
- Who are the key participants involved in the Day In The Life of a Developer?
- What are some of the expected outcomes of a Day In The Life of a Developer for them?

It is important to identify a project as next step for the planning meeting with customer.  The project should reflect a typical development process spanning idea to deployment, for the company.  

Here are some resources that can be used as starting point for the pitch:

### Planning meeting with customer

Planning a Day In The Life of a Developer can be done within an hour or less, given the right expectation, focus and people involved.  Below are aspects to be considered when planning the Day In The Life of a Developer.

#### Define a Day In The Life Of A Developer

- Who are the members of the team involved in developing an application?
- What application will be demonstrated to highlight development from idea to deployment?
- What context or conditions are being considered?
- What triggering event initiates the work flowing through the development process?

- Process
- Tools
- Workflows
- Questions

#### People

In order to help facilitate a Day In The Life of a Developer, a number of GitLab team members will be required to take part. The roles of these members generally fall into the following:

- **Facilitator** - A team member fully versed in the software development process who is responsible for leading the session; ensuring that discussion is staying on-topic, at the right level and at the required pace.
- **Account Leader** - The account leader's responsibility is to ensure that the long term strategic vision for the customer/prospect is considered when discussing desired future state and they can also provide additional context to the current state.
- **Scribe** - A team member who's primary purpose is to document the session, capture key metrics as they emerge which will later be used to create a current state schematic diagram.

#### Process

The process which we will go through, at a high level, is as follows:

1. Why we are here? (champion led)
1. Re-iterate expectations set in the planning meeting
    1. Start and end points for the Day In The Life of a Developer
1. Current state
    1. Initial process "walk-through" for the prospect or customer to demonstrate
        1. Capture people, processes and technology
    1. Analyze and identify bottlenecks and improvement areas
1. Design future state
    1. Review the expectations, to align the team on the target they are aiming to create
    1. Determine "right work" (which processes and steps are required for the future state to be optimal)
        1. Remove processes and process steps when they are truely unnecessary
        1. Add processes and process steps when they can optimize **overall** process time and lead time
    1. Creating an optimized work flow
        1. Aim to reduce the lead time (LT), process time (PT) and achieve a higher percent complete and accurate (%C&A) for every process block where prossible
        1. Utilize and leverage GitLab capabilities to improve the development process where applicable
        1. Use Lean countermeasures and improvement tools
1. Develop transformation plan (likely completed async)
    1. Create a day In The Life Readout to present to the customer.  The readout will include a review of their current development process and suggestions for how their process can be improved.
    1. For each process block transformation, capture the measurable target, proposed countermeasures, execution method, owner and timeline (later, status as well)       

#### Tools

### Executive Briefing - Summarize the Findings

The final meeting as part of the Day in the Life of a Developer process is the findings and next steps presentation (though it's called an executive presentation, it's expected to be a two-way discussion). The high level topics of this meeting are:

1. Summary of planning outcomes; what process was to be mapped and what target goals were created
1. Summary of the current state mapping 
1. Summary of the proposed future state mapping 
1. Highlight the key differences, expected process and business benefits
1. Walkthrough of recommendations
1. Walkthrough and gain agreement for the transformation plan. The transformation plan should be built in conjunction with professional services to yield best results. Please read how to position professional services in an opportunity [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/#positioning-professional-services)
1. Define next steps and suggest a review date

Example template of the executive briefing can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/133mECaV2vfUQGIn03mixXSI6ENrc4T-R_vRwXBRManA/edit?usp=sharing). Please modify accordingly to suit your customer's need.

It is recommended to review the executive briefing with your champion, key stakeholder before the final meeting to collect additional feedback. The goal is to then deliver it jointly to the broader team to gain agreement.
