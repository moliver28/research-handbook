## Engage with an Architect
Technical Architects (TAs) play a crucial role in scoping potential engagements where the technical challenges and the required effort are not clear. TA's can be included in not only estimating and planning but also in positioning the value of GitLab to technical stakeholders, helping to align our solutions with the clientâ€™s technical and business goals. To ensure effective and efficient use of TA resources, please follow the guidelines below when including a TA: 

### Scoping and Positioning Calls

Please reach out to your assigned Architect ([PS and Sales Team Mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdehii3Eqp_CiYsGT3dDb0nKbbtwpxKQlni7t3ZgfCs/edit#heading=h.1er41qhhpoj5)) with at least two business days' notice, along with any relevant context, notes, or information they will need. This ensures they are fully prepared and informed going into the call. If your assisgned TA does not specialize in the topics of the call they will work with you and the TA team to idenfity an Architect who aligns with the [Skills Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1itsxb4wIgp9_sIuAv5paWtLsPdEE-jRbHjRxO4QXmmo/edit#gid=0)

Please reach out to your [assigned Architect](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdehii3Eqp_CiYsGT3dDb0nKbbtwpxKQlni7t3ZgfCs/edit#heading=h.1er41qhhpoj5) with at least two days business notice along with any context, notes or information that they will need to esnure they ahve context going into the call.

### Scoping related Questions 
For Scoping issues add the label `Scoping::Needs_TA_Assistance` to the related GitLab issue with a clear ask in the comments for them to follow up on. [Scoping Information](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/engagement-mgmt/scoping-information/)

### General Inquiries and Discussions:
For broader technical questions or about the role of TAs, utilize the #ps-ta-ama channel on Slack. Specific discussions related to an ongoing Statement of Work (SOW) should be conducted within the comments of the associated scoping issue to ensure context is passed on during delivery. Conversations in slack have a limited retention and often are unavailble during the delivery. 

## Approvals

# Getting a Review
Any SOWs that have not had a TA involved in the scoping will need the `TA::Needs-Review` label added to the scoping issue to ensure we are reviewing it from a delivery standpoint. This does not include SKU's or standard migrations scoped with the estimate sheet. If the review is time sensitiveor needs more than 2 days for review please tag the Regional TA Manager for attention.

TA's will review SOW's within two business days to identify any clarifications needed for Actions, Assumptions and Deliverables. `TA::Approved` label will be added when the scope of work is reviewed by the TA. 

<!-- ## Estimates

We are working on transitioning the original [Estimate Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YKMyflzsA-VPEVobB82zC8-n0hlC-uRBtiNB7Fm-kZg/edit#gid=674039849) to a new [Estimate Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSV_inLaN4tCIJ6jKkZFuHm7KGlfTHQ93LEY44okRIE/edit#gid=854215547).
