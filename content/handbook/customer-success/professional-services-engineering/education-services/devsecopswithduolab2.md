## Objectives

To get started with GitLab Duo, we will test out some of the basic code generation features. Code generation allows you to prompt GitLab Duo for code that solves a specific programming problem. 

## Task A. Generating some Simple Code

> In this task, we are going to generate a basic hello world program in Go using GitLab Duo. This task will help you get familiar with the process of creating code in a project with GitLab Duo. 

1. Navigate to your GitLab Duo project

1. Select Edit > Web IDE

1. In the Web IDE, locate the GitLab Duo icon. This icon will be the last item in the left side bar, showing the GitLab icon.

1. In the chat text input, enter the text `how do I create a hello world go program?`

1. The AI should respond with code similar to this:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("hello world") 
}
```

> Note: Any AI generator will be non-deterministic in nature. This means that when you prompt an AI, there is a possibility that your answer may differ from someone else's answer. If you ever receive an output that appears significantly different from the lab guide, please use the lab guide snippets to ensure you can follow along with other examples.

1. Copy the code generated by the AI. Select the explorer icon in the left sidebar to return to your code.

1. Right click in the left sidebar, and select New File

1. Name the file `main.go`.

1. Inside the file, paste the AI generated code.

You have now created a simple hello world program in Go! In the next section, you will learn how to explain AI generated code.

## Task B. Explaining AI Code

> Being able to generate code is only one part of the software development process. In many cases, you also want to be able to understand code that has been written. Whether the code is generated by coworkers or AI, GitLab Duo can explain any code snippet you provide.

1. In the Web IDE, highlight all of the code in your `main.go` file.

1. Select the GitLab Duo icon from the left sidebar.

1. With the code still highlighted, type `/explain` into the GitLab Duo chat.

1. You will see an explanation of all of the code you have highlighted as a result of the prompt.

## Task C. Commit your Code

> Now that you have code generated and you understand the code, you can commit the code into your project.

1. Select Source Control in the left sidebar.

1. Enter any commit message, then select `Commit to 'main'`

1. If your receive a prompt stating `You are committing your changes to the default branch`, select `Continue`.

1. Select `Go to Project` to return to your GitLab repository.
