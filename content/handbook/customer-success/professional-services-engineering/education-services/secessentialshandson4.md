# Lab 4: Enable and Configure License Compliance

> Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes

> **You are viewing the latest Version 16.x instructions.** You are using v16 if your group URL is `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-learn-labs/...`. If your group URL starts with `https://ilt.gitlabtraining.cloud` or `https://spt.gitlabtraining.cloud`, please use the [Version 15.x instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/blob/d14ee71aeac2054c72ce96e8b35ba2511f86a7ca/content/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/education-services/secessentialshandson4.md).

## Objectives

When you add new dependencies to a project, you need to carefully consider how the licenses of the dependencies impact the project. To ensure that license requirements are met, you can add a policy to require approval for newly detected licenses.

In addition to scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities, the dependency scanner will also record the license that each dependency uses.

The License Compliance report will generate a list of all of the licenses detected in the project that are out of compliance with the project policies.

## Prerequisites

1. Open your browser to to the **Security Labs** project that you created in Lab 1.

    > If you closed the tab or lost the link, open a browser tab and start typing `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-learn-labs` in your URL and the group should appear in your history.

1. Before beginning this lab and all later labs, you should disable any jobs and scanners that you enabled in previous labs to speed up pipeline runtime. You should have already completed this at the end of Lab 3.

## Task A. License Compliance Scans

1. Navigate to **Secure > License compliance**.

1. Click any of the licenses to view more details about the license and the compliance requirements.

## Task B. Approve and Deny Licenses

> Let's assume that your team has approved the MIT license. If any license aside from the MIT license exists in a dependency, it must be approved before the merge request can be complete.

1. Navigate to **Secure > Policies**.

1. Click the **New policy** button.

1. Click **Scan result policy > Select policy**.

1. Input any name (ex. `ScanApprovedPolicy`) and description for the policy.

1. Set the **Policy status** to **Enabled**.

1. In **Rules**, set the **Select scan type** dropdown menu to **License Scan**. Ensure that `all protected branches` with `No exceptions` is selected for the merge request target.

1. Set the **Status is** dropdown menu to **Newly Detected**.

1. Set the first dropdown in the **License is** section to **Except**.

    > To exit the multi-select dropdown, click anywhere outside of it.

1. In the **Select license types** dropdown, click `MIT License`. There are several licenses with similar names, so be sure to pick the right one.

1. In the **Actions** section, require 1 approval from an Individual user. Click your username as the approval user.

1. Click **Configure with a merge request**. Leave the **Override project approval settings** checkbox selected.

1. In the resulting merge request, click the **Merge** button.

1. When you create a policy, GitLab will create a new project for managing the policies. After you click **Merge**, you will need to navigate back to your original project.

## Task C. View the License Compliance report with categorized licenses

1. Click **Secure > Licenses compliance**.

2. Notice that GitLab now describes every license except the **MIT License** as a policy violation. This report helps to flag existing dependencies which may contain licenses that you have not approved.

## Task D. Create an MR that adds a dependency with a denied license

1. Create a new branch named `add-dnspython-dependency`

1. Add a new dependency to the `add-dnspython-dependency` branch **(not the `main` branch!)** by pasting `dnspython==2.1.0` as a new line at the end of `requirements.txt`. Commit the change.

1. Click the **Create merge request** button.

1. Leave all fields as their default values and click **Create merge request**.

1. Wait for the pipeline for the merge request to complete.

1. Once the pipeline completes, refresh the page. A license compliance scan will now display, showing 1 new license detected. Click **Full report**.

1. The license compliance report will list all of the licenses that are no longer in compliance with the project policy.

1. Return to the merge request overview.

1. Note that the merge status will appear stating **Requires 1 approval from policy**.

1. A new comment is also added to the activity of the merge request, stating that a policy violation was detected.

    > This merge request now requires additional approval because `dnspython` does not use an approved license. A reviewer can now verify if the license is ok to proceed with before the merge is complete.

## Task E. Lab Policy Cleanup

> To ensure that you can merge branches into main without approval, it is best to disable the policy.

1. Navigate to **Secure > Policies**.

2. Click on the policy you created. Click **Edit policy**.

3. Click **Delete Policy**.

4. Click **Merge** on the resulting merge request.
