## Lab 4 - Backup and Restore GitLab

> Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes

> **You are viewing the latest Version 16.x instructions.** If you are using `https://spt.gitlabtraining.cloud`, please use the [Version 15.x instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/blob/d14ee71aeac2054c72ce96e8b35ba2511f86a7ca/content/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/education-services/sysadminhandson4.md).

### Task A. Configure backup settings

1. Open an SSH session on your GitLab instance server.

2. Search for the location of backup settings in gitlab.rb.

```bash
sudo grep -n backup_path /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
```

3. Note the line number for the setting `gitlab_rails['backup_path']`.

4. Create a new location to hold GitLab backups.

```bash
sudo mkdir /tmp/backups
```

5. Edit gitlab.rb to change the backup path. Replace "123" with the line number noted in step 3.

```bash
sudo sed -i '123s@\/var\/opt\/gitlab\/backups@\/tmp\/backups@' /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
sudo sed -i '123s/#//' /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
```
> Here, we are using the sed command to do text replacements inside the gitlab.rb file without having to use a text editor like vim. 

6. Reconfigure to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

### Task B. Backup the GitLab instance

1. Take a full backup of the GitLab instance.

```bash
sudo gitlab-backup create
```

2. After the backup completes, go to the backup location and inspect the backup file.

```bash
sudo ls /tmp/backups
sudo tar -tvf /tmp/backups/<backup_filename>
```

### Task C. Make some changes to GitLab settings

1. Sign into your GitLab instance with a web browser and open your sidebar. In the bottom left corner, click **Admin area**.

2. In the left sidebar, select **Settings** > **General**.

3. Expand **Account and limit** and change the maximum attachment size to 500 MiB, and the default project limits to 10000.

4. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

5. Refresh the page and verify your changes were applied.

### Task D. Restore from backup

1. Return to the SSH session on your GitLab instance server.

2. Move your backup file to the location GitLab requires for performing the restore.

```bash
sudo cp /tmp/backups/<backup_filename> /var/opt/gitlab/backups/
```

3. Ensure the backup file has correct permissions for performing the restore.

```bash
sudo chown git:git /var/opt/gitlab/backups/<backup_filename>
```

4. Stop the puma and sidekiq services before restoring.

```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl stop puma
sudo gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
sudo gitlab-ctl status
```

5. Restore from backup. Replace *<backup_timestamp>* with the portion of the backup filename up to and including `-ee`. For example, if the backup file name starts with 1663207732_2022_09_15_15.3.3-ee, the command will be `sudo gitlab-backup restore BACKUP=1663207732_2022_09_15_15.3.3-ee`.

```bash
sudo gitlab-backup restore BACKUP=<backup_timestamp>
```

6. Type `yes` when prompted during the restore operation. You may see what looks like error messages. That is normal.

7. Restart sidekiq and puma services.

```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl start sidekiq
sudo gitlab-ctl start puma
sudo gitlab-ctl status
```

8. Wait up to 5 minutes before refreshing GitLab in your web browser. Verify that the aximum attachment size and the default project limits you changed revert back to the defaults (i.e. when the backup was taken).
