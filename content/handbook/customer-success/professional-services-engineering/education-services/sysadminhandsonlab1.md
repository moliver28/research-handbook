# GitLab System Administration Hands-on Guide: Lab 1


## Lab 1 - Install GitLab 

In this lab, you will install GitLab and its necessary dependencies on a virtual machine using the command line.
Before you get started, complete the following:

- Open the [GitLab Linux Installation](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#almalinux-8) page in a separate browser tab for reference.
- Open the lab setup instructions provided by the instructor to locate your assigned public IPv4 address for your Omnibus server. You will use SSH to access the training environment.

### Task A. Access training environment

1. On your local computer, open a terminal window.

1. Use your assigned IP address and SSH key file to log in to the server that will host your GitLab Omnibus install:

```bash
ssh -i YOUR_ASSIGNED_SSH_KEYFILE ec2-user@YOUR_ASSIGNED_PUBLIC_IP
```

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. If your system displays an authentication warning, type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### Task B. Install necessary dependencies

1. Install Postfix so GitLab can send notification emails by using the command below:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y curl policycoreutils perl postfix
```

1. Start and enable Postfix using hte ```systemctl enable``` and the ```systemctl start``` commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable postfix
sudo systemctl start postfix
```

### Task C. Install GitLab

1. Add the GitLab install repository via the ```curl``` command:

```bash
curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```

1. Install the GitLab package using the command below. Use your training system's assigned public IP address in lieu of a fully qualified domain name.

```bash
sudo EXTERNAL_URL="YOUR_ASSIGNED_PUBLIC_IP" dnf install -y gitlab-ee
```

> Note: This step may take a few minutes to complete.

### Task D. Log in and reset password

1. During installation, a password is randomly generated and stored for 24 hours in `/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password`. To view the generated password, use the command below:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
```

1. Copy the password shown in the output to your clipboard.

1. Using a web browser, navigate to `http://YOUR_ASSIGNED_PUBLIC_IP/`. Use your IP address, and not the fully qualified domain name.

1. To log in, type in `root` as your username, and the password copied previously for your password.

1. Once logged in, in the upper left corner of the GitLab landing page, select your root user avatar, then **Edit Profile**.

1. In the left navigation pane **User Settings**, select **Password**.

1. In the **Current password** text box, enter the temporary root password used for initial login.

1. Complete the remaining fields with a new, permanent password of your choosing.
