Iteration 0 starts with our internal EM>PS Transition meeting and goes through the Planning and Design Sessions with the Customer. Please reference [Iteration 0 Fundamentals](../iteration-0-fundamentals/_index.md) as we prepare for the following stages.

A reminder to [think big in discovery](../discovery/_index.md) and consider [team alignment for production readiness](../iteration-0-fundamentals/_index.md#engagement-planning). A well-rounded Iteration 0, helps us (and the Customer team) head into the Initial Planning and Design meetings with our customers confidently.

For **Transformational planning** throughout iterations, please [reference here.](../iteration-planning-per-service-offering/_index.md).

## EM>PS Transition

We use the [Scheduling Intake issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SchedulingIntakeQuestions.md?ref_type=heads) as a guide for the meeting, as it will help us map the next steps with our Customers. The Scheduling Intake issue is created and attached to the Customer Epic.

The Delivery team can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bpyhc-a1z573EsyIQtUE-7HS_QauDVmQsHP25PD9i1A/edit) to facilitate the meeting to ensure all points are considered from the Scheduling Intake issue. For larger/Transformation Migrations, please be sure to reference the above.

The output of this meeting is to ensure the Delivery team is prepared, and we have a plan heading into the Customer Kickoff & Discovery & Planning sessions with our customers

## Stakeholder Planning Meeting

During this meeting, the PM between the Gitlab & Customer side meet to review the high level scope, and gather any onboarding material that is still missing. This is an opportunity to meet each other and begin to build trust. Additionally, this is an opportunity to review how we plan to manage the project our of Gitlab, along with a quick overview of our methodology. (review suggested cadences, iteration planning & review, preferred updated for status, etc.) We will take this information to our Customer kickoff and review it with the broader project teams.

The PM will take information from this discussion & the EM\>PS transition process and continue to build out the following for our [Customer Kickoff](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XUljBcQUZgQA-0fhQ5UayiEGtp4Of3xsaFGpVxdoDS4/edit#slide=id.p1):

1. Project Roadmap (workstream overview, use EM timeline as a reference point)
2. Definitions of success
3. Review the project within Gitlab (provide collateral as needed) & other tools (Zoom, Slack, etc.)
4. Review & agree on Communication plan (iterations, cadence scheduling)
5. Project Burndown (google sheets)
6. RAID tracking
   1. Risks for discussion
7. Next steps

## Customer Kickoff

Before we enter Project Kickoff, the goal is to confidently be on the same understanding of Project expectations as the Customer. This is why we have spent so much effort gathering the initial information from both the account team & the Customer.
