The project handoff process is a critical component of our project management methodology. The primary purpose of the project handoff process is to maintain continuity and efficiency in project execution. By ensuring that the incoming resource is fully briefed and equipped with all necessary information, we minimize disruption and maintain the project's momentum. It ensures a smooth transition when an internal consultant or project manager is replaced or when additional resources are added to a project. This guide provides an overview of the process, its importance, and instructions on how to conduct a successful handoff.

## The Handoff Process

### Preparing for the Handoff
- Before the handoff, the outgoing resource and/or the PM should create a project transition issue in the [Customer Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/professional-services-delivery/gitlab-professional-services) using the resources transition template.

### Scheduling the Transition Call
The transition call should be scheduled at a time convenient for all key participants, including the outgoing and incoming resources, and any relevant internal stakeholders. Ensure that the agenda is shared with all participants ahead of the meeting.

### Conducting the Transition Call
During the transition call, follow the structured agenda to ensure all critical aspects of the handoff are covered. The agenda includes sections on project overview, roles and responsibilities, key stakeholders, ongoing tasks, risks and issues, and tools and access along with desired outcomes.

### Post-Call Actions
After the transition call, the following actions should be taken:
- **Document Review:** The incoming resource should review all provided documentation in detail.
- **Follow-Up Meetings:** Schedule any necessary follow-up meetings to address questions or provide additional training.
- **Access Setup:** Ensure that the incoming resource has all necessary access to tools, systems, and documentation.
