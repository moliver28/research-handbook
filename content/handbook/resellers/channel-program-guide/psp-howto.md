## GitLab Professional Services Partner (PSP) Designation

Please refer to [this section](/handbook/resellers/channel-program-guide/#gitlab-partner-services-program) of our handbook. There you can find the requirements you'll need to satisfy as a company to become a PSP.
All the benefits you can get out of this designation are documented there too.

## GitLab Professional Service Engineer (PSE) Certifications

To become a PSP, amongst other things, you'll need 3 of your team members to get certified as PSEs.

To do that, please follow these steps:

* Go to the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) and select Training → Start Training from the menu.

* Scroll down and click on: "GitLab Certified Professional Services Engineer Learning Path"

* The newly opened page has two sections:

  * Certification Prep:

    * You can use the self-paced online content here to prepare for the exams.

    * These are completely free of charge.

  * Certification Exams:

    * These are the 6 exams that each of your 3 team members have to take successfully in order to become certified.

    * All partners can purchase the certifications with a 20% discount off the list price.

    * Some partners are eligible to receive  vouchers with higher discounts in accordance with the [Program Incentive Guide](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/s/assets?id=712791&renderMode=Collection&q=partner%20incentive%20guide). (Search for "Certification Funds" on page 4.)

### PSE FAQ

#### How much time does it take to get PSE certified?

Here are a couple of **rough estimates** for people with different skill levels (1 day \= 8 hours):

* GitLab users who are deeply familiar with the product: **3–4** days.

* DevOps professionals familiar with other products on the market, but without prior GitLab experience: **10–12** days.

* IT professionals without DevOps knowledge and without GitLab experience: **15–20** days.

#### Do I have to take the exams in order?

No, it's up to you. You just need to finish all 6 to get the PSE status.

## Not-for-Resale (NFR) licenses

You can find more information about this partner-only benefit [here](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#working-with-gitlab---technical).

The "Certification Prep" courses in the PSE learning path (see above) will provide your team members with access to GitLab environments in order to get hands-on experience with certain parts of our product. But those are just temporary. By applying for our NFR licenses, your team can set up permanent GitLab environments in which you can freely experiment and learn our product. You can also use these environments for customer-facing demos. You can find assets to support these activities [below](#further-technical-education).

We advise you to apply for this benefit twice: once for the SaaS (.com) and once for the self-managed version of our licenses. This way, you can have two environments: one on gitlab.com, which is always up-to-date and stable and which you'll be able to use in the future for customer demos. And one on your self-managed infrastructure which you'll have admin access to, and you can use it to fully learn how to configure and manage a GitLab installation.

## Further technical education

To further deepen our partners' technical understanding of GitLab, our team has created [this handbook page](/handbook/resellers/partner-enablement/). Alongside the formal certification process, we highly recommend for your team to get familiar with the content here. We keep this page up to date, and it has our best resources to prepare partner staff both for technical pre-sales and technical post-sales activities with customers.
